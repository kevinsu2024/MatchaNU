It will explore different types of musical performances, the career paths and obstacles faced by well-known and unfairly forgotten performers, and consider ongoing controversies about performance. Specific issues will include mythic narratives of musicianship, the past and present development of historically informed performance and what these mean for conservatory students in 2022, African and Asian musicians across time and space, questions of gender and race in popular music and art music past and present, and histories of performance at Northwestern, among others. By these means, music students will gain introductory literacy in diverse types of music and performance practices, learn about the legacies of specific musicians, and better understand intersections between creativity and commerce in diverse contexts, all grounded by the idea of performance. Students will learn how to use archived material across media to conduct individual research on musicians from past and present, including crossover between genres and their own musical heritage.",

    "ClassOverview": "Scholars, critics, and concertgoers alike regularly characterize Ludwig van Beethoven as the West's, if not the world's, greatest composer. Why? The answer lies in a complex web of issues, based partially on the unquestionable power and aesthetic appeal of Beethoven's music, but also on concepts of genius, heroism, politics, myth, and meaning in music that were shifting in the early nineteenth century. This course aims to better understand Beethoven's music by situating it within the aesthetics of the French Revolutionary period, the genres of Classicism and the new subjectivity of the nineteenth century; probing the gestural intersections between Beethoven's vocal and untexted repertoires; mapping Beethoven's expansion of music genres; exploring important performers of Beethoven's music; understanding connections between Beethoven's music and late eighteenth-century religious philosophies; and considering performance practice from the nineteenth century to today in a global context. Although it is a fairly large 300-level class, it will be run as a pro-seminar, meaning graduate-level group discussion of scholarly readings from upper level academic journals, and independent research work, is expected of all students. Students taking this course should have some background in music history and performance; some reading knowledge of German is a plus. This is a historical course, not a music theory/analysis course.",

    "ClassOverview": "By the late 18th century, the field opera in Paris had been largely conquered by non-French composers such as Gluck, Piccinni, Sacchini, Salieri, and Cherubini. This foreign occupation continues well into the 19th century, but by the second half of that century begins to yield to a vigorous new school of French composers who created a series of extraordinarily successful works. Some of these (Bizet'sCarmen) are still popular today, others have faded somewhat (Gounod'sFaust, Massenet'sManon), and still others have virtually vanished from the repertoire (Mignonby Ambroise Thomas,Lakm by Leo Delibes).  Amid these shifting sands, the tradition of grand opera as embodied in the works of Hal vy and Meyerbeer have undergone a strong reassessment, while at the opposite end, the operettas of Offenbach carry on in an absurd, satirical, and delightful world of their own. In this course, we will explore a selection of these works against the background of French history from Napoleon to the end of the 19th century. Along the way we will examine the work of important librettists (Eug ne Scribe, Jules Barbier, Henri Meilhac, Ludovic Hal ) and the literary and theatrical works which served as a basis for operatic plots.",

The hope is not to necessarily become great artists, but rather learn to quickly and effectively communicate ideas with others. We are going to design things that are disruptive and imaginative in an effort to create the future, and in order to do so, we have to be able to help others see what we see.We will explore the process of generative ideation as fueled by design sketching as well as presentation methods for communicating design concepts effectively. We will focus on user experience, human emotion, form and the use of materials in design and develop multiple concepts across a range of industries. We will also imagine and develop ideas at a range of scales, from handheld products, to large architectural installations. We will also work to develop your unique sketching style and aesthetic.We will work in a studio culture involving a fast-paced work environment, peer-review, and an opportunity to learn from a wide variety of resources. Reading and exercises will be provided on a project-by-project basis and you will also be encouraged to explore other types of visual communication that you find interesting in the development of concepts.",

The projects require a mix of skill sets from within and outside of engineering, and more importantly, a well-integrated team where everyone brings expertise from your own field of study to build on and share. These projects can become significant pieces in your portfolio, allowing you to demonstrate how you apply your discipline in the context of design, how you tackle a complex problem, how you work on an interdisciplinary team, and how you communicate professionally across diverse audiences and for different purposes. Enrollment is restricted to junior and senior level, and instructor consent is required. Students must have completed either DSGN 106-1 or DSGN 208, and it is recommended that you have completed at least two design projects.",

The only drawings by Leonardo that were published during his lifetime were illustrations for a textbook on geometry. The artist's final journal entry, written only days before his death, included attempts at a geometric proof.  A friend of the artist once lamented in a letter, He devotes much of his time to geometry, and has no fondness at all for the paintbrush.  What compelled Leonardo's fascination with this subject?  In this interdisciplinary class, we will explore Leonardo's geometric studies, using them as a vehicle for our own studies of artistic and industrial processes. Students will collaborate with artists, manufacturers, and technologists to produce sculptural objects in a range of materials. The course will culminate in a public iron pour in which we will attempt to translate several of Leonardo's sketches into cast-iron 3D pieces using a historical furnace in honor of the artist's work.",

We encounter services on a daily basis, across industries such as retail, travel, banking, and health-care. Even product-based organizations and offerings often have an important element of service that can be a driver of their success. While services dominate our everyday experience, many of them are in desperate need of redesigning and often complete rethinking. Organizations are waking up to this and increasingly seeing service design, not as a cost center, but as an opportunity for growth.During our class together, we will explore the improvement of existing services and the creation of new services. We will address the challenges and opportunities when it comes to designing for services, by exploring the underlying principles, traditional methods and tools, and newer frontiers of what it means to deeply understand people's needs, goals and aspirations, and to orchestrate a human-centered, responsive, and compelling service experience. This studio course will introduce you to the fundamentals of service design. You will practice individual techniques and how you might use the techniques throughout your design process.",

However, at the heart of every successful startup is a certain level of financial literacy needed by founders to guide and navigate the startup from simply an idea to (hopefully) a lucrative exit.  Without a firm grasp on accounting, many founders fail to see their startup reach its full potential, or fail outright.The goal of this course is to lay the foundation for what a founder needs to know to successfully launch and scale a startup, taught from the accountant's perspective.  You'll learn not only what exactly accounting is, but how it applies to startups specifically.  In addition, we will teach the basics that will enable you to manage your accounting operations during the infancy of a startup's lifecycle.  Further, we will provide founders with a level of understanding that equips them to make actionable, strategic decisions from accurate and insightful accounting.",

ME undergraduates are required to take either Thermodynamics II (ME 370) or this course as a part of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum. Most undergraduates take it during their junior year.This course essentially picks up where ME 241 left off. Unlike ME 241 where the subject of fluid mechanics was developed by synthesis starting from elementary ideas on the nature of fluids, this course takes as its starting point the fundamental equations of fluid flow and proceeds by way of analysis to explore its myriad consequences and applications.These areas are laid out as broad swaths of contiguous territories: viscous flows, inviscid flows, almost inviscid flows (boundary layer theory), compressible flows and so on. As we travel through this landscape, theoretical principles are applied to a wide variety of practical problems.In ME 241 (a prerequisite for this course) the concept of a fluid and its properties was introduced. The subject was then developed by a method of synthesis by systematically applying Newton's laws to fluid elements culminating in the fundamental equations of fluid flow the Euler system of equations (if the fluid is inviscid) or the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of viscous flows. In this course we follow a complementary approach. After giving a brief review of the fundamental equations of fluid flow, we use the method of analysis to unravel the physical content of these equations. In the process, we learn about a variety of fluid phenomena and its applications such as: supersonic flow and the principles of design of jet engines, viscous boundary layers and the consequent drag on airplane wings, the concept of vorticity and how it describes phenomena such as tornadoes etc.Topics Include:  Steady viscous flows (exact solutions)Poiseuille flow in round pipesCouette flow between parallel plates  Inviscid flowsconcept of vorticity and the generalized Bernoulli theoremirrotational (or potential) flows - the velocity potential and the stream function  Compressible layersone dimensional isentropic flows - the Laval nozzleShocks  Boundary layersPrandtl's boundary layer theory for almost inviscid flows",

    "ClassOverview": "Metamaterials that mimic the order in matters have opened an exciting gateway to reach unprecedented physical properties and functionality unattainable from naturally existing materials. The atoms and molecules in metamaterials can be tailored in shape and size, the lattice constant and inter-atomic interaction can be precisely tuned, and defects can be designed and placed at desired locations. Recent studies have demonstrated engineering metamaterials with unprecedented characteristics such as left-handedness with simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability, negative lens that focus electromagnetic waves far below the diffraction limit, artificial magnetism from nonmagnetic materials, and invisibility cloaking of electromagnetic energy.This introductory course is designed to cover the technology fundamentals of the optical and mechanical metamaterials, micro-/nano-fabrication methodologies, and prospective applications. Specific topics include sub-wavelength waveguiding and focusing, super-resolution imaging and nano-lithography beyond the diffraction limit of the light, negative refraction, and invisibility cloaking. Plasmonic metamaterials, bio- sensing, enhanced Raman scattering, extraordinary transmission, Graphene Plasmonics, light-trapping for solar cell will also be discussed.",

A good product will sell are pretty common words from an engineer. As we all know that is not the case. Our overall goal is to help you develop an in-depth understanding of marketing so that you can better partner with marketers going forward. This class should empower you to not just understand marketing but to allow you to challenge marketing strategies and insure in-market success. We cannot transform you into a seasoned marketer in one class, but we do intend to expose you to a number of marketing concepts and challenges and allow you to figure out solutions.The most successful companies build inter-disciplinary teams that include engineers and marketers. 405 will transform you into a more rounded engineer as well as help you better understand the challenge marketers face.",

    "ClassOverview": "Analytics is a very hot topic.  Davenport's Competing on Analytics article in the Harvard Business Review started the movement by showing the tremendous value in analytics.  He showed how firms can gain a competitive advantage by using data to make better decisions.  Many different organizations, including businesses, governments, and non-profits, are now making significant investments in analytics to make better decisions.However, as the analytics movement gains momentum, there is a danger that the term is not well-defined and is just being used as a buzzword.  This is not helped by the popular business press, consultants, and vendors who use the term analytics for just a single aspect of the field, or, worse, use the term to just help repackage an old idea.  The problem with the lack of definition is that organizations may be misled with their investments or miss out on more significant analytics opportunities.Despite the confusion about the definition of analytics, it is not a fad.  Analytics is here to stay.  Data has become too valuable to ignore (some are even arguing that data is a fundamental business input along with labor and capital).  Analytics is the way to turn data into better decisions.The field is evolving quickly and, luckily, serious thinkers are converging on a definition that encompasses the wide range of different aspects of analytics.",

The manager of a new product development project must have the skills to manage such an inter-disciplinary team. Although this course is for engineers, it will cover aspects of the New Product Development process across these disciplines.",

The course is designed to prepare you to lead high-performing, successful firms in the future and to effectively lead your own career.A key leadership task is to assemble the skills, talents and resources of individuals and groups into those combinations that best solve the organizational problem at hand. You must manage people, information, and processes to accomplish organizational goals; you must make things happen, and often not under conditions or timeframes of your own choosing. The successful execution of these goals requires leaders to be able to diagnose problems, make effective decisions, influence others, optimize cross-functional teams, drive organizational change, negotiate strategically, design reward systems, and shape organizational culture. This course prepares you to achieve these objectives. The course provides fundamental tools from the behavioral and social sciences that will improve your ability to analyze organizational dynamics and to take robust action. Throughout the course students will begin to acquire leadership skills and tools using an applied, practical approach.",

The course will guide students through doing original research using primary sources such as media archives, material in presidential libraries, and the speeches, letters, and oral history collections of leading politicians and journalists. Students will dive deeply into journalism history and make connections between the past and present. Potential themes to be explored include:* Influence of media ownership on how news is framed* Power of the White House to pressure and threaten journalists* Impact of changing technology on the dissemination of information* The ethics and practicality of using anonymous sources* Responses of journalists to increasing political polarization and declining power of political parties* Weakening of the watchdog role of a free press in democracies* Growing sophistication of presidential marketing strategies to set media agenda* Shifting norms of objectivity in journalism* Changing public opinion towards presidents and the media* Roles played by individual journalists, political leaders and media outlets",

    "ClassOverview": "Stereotypes.  Coded language.  Unconscious bias.  How do these concepts factor into the media search for truth?  How might they stand in the way of public understanding of social difference?  Clearly, the media affect the way we see one another across social boundaries established by such characteristics as race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality.  How do the perspectives formed by this mediated reality ultimately affect our decisions on public policy in such areas as political participation, equal rights and criminal justice?  These and other considerations are central to professional journalism responsibility and enlightened public choice making.  Without question, the media are vital to the effective operation of our democratic system by providing information that should be free of the kind of bias that can distort the public participation process.Through discussion of principles of media professionalism and ethics, and an examination of some of the hot topics featured in today's headlines, this course will set a framework for recognizing and analyzing media narrative framing, as well as the representation of traditionally marginalized groups within that narrative frame.  Ultimately, we will develop a deeper appreciation of media responsibility.  Just as important, we will expand our sense of media literacy in considering a path forward whether as professional journalists or engaged citizens as we navigate the challenging terrain of an increasingly diverse society, one in which we all can appreciate the value of social difference and multiple perspectives",

Count on developing your own understandings of how the country reached this point, what role journalism plays and what will happen next, after the most tumultuous campaign for the presidency and Congress in at least 50 years. We will explore such themes as polarization, political image-making and advertising, voting rights and voter suppression, as well as campaign rhetoric and policy issues. We will explore the 2020 campaign and consider the reckoning faced by Republicans and Democrats alike, as the new presidential term begins in Washington and both parties look ahead.

Further complicating the reporting environment is the rising hostility toward the media, partly the result of deliberate attempts to undermine journalistic credibility, which has led officials and the public to increasingly turn to the courts to attack journalists and suppress information.

As a journalist, I can't think of anything more exhilarating than moving beyond the center of the storm, introducing readers to people they otherwise would never have reason to meet, to spend time in places they otherwise might never visit. We'll ask these questions: Why is it important to write on people without wealth or power who are often ignored or whose stories are seldom told? What does it tell us about who we are as a nation? What does it tell us about our institutions and those who wield power? How does one gain access to an immigrant community or to a prison or to a small rural town? How do you immerse yourself in the lives of others while remaining honest about what you see and hear? What are the ethics involved in writing about people who are not public officials? How do you establish empathy?We'll also talk about whose place it is to tell the stories of others across lines of ethnicity, race, gender and economic station. We'll focus on ways to reinforce the dignity and agency of the people whose experience you set out to capture, including looking at ways to tell stories in people's own words. We'll discuss the potency of deeply intimate stories - but not forget the need for context and history.In the course, there will be a lot of reading -- books and magazine pieces - as well as listening to radio pieces and watching some film. I hope to bring in a couple of guests during the quarter.  There will also be a fair amount of writing. There will be two short writing assignments, as well as a longer piece which will be due at the end of the quarter.

In each case, investigative reporting has played an essential role, and over the years, it has proven to be one of the highest forms of journalism: shedding light on wrongdoing and exposing corruption at the highest levels. In this dynamic course grounded in real-time investigative reporting, students will expose a problem of significant national or international importance and chronicle its effects on the lives and livelihoods of those most impacted, particularly those in disenfranchised communities. Throughout the winter and spring quarters, students will take on one critical subject using the tools honed by investigative reporters: documents, data and sources. Students will dig deep and learn on the go, reporting on a complicated topic, synthesizing findings and writing or producing a compelling, long-form investigative story suitable for publication. In the past six months, students at the Medill Investigative Lab have published more than 15 stories in The Washington Post, focused on the impact of COVID-19 in America's nursing homes. The stories have prompted calls for investigations by members of Congress. The winter course is a primer: Working remotely, students will devote a tremendous amount of time digging for information and framing stories. In the spring, students will report out stories on the ground, traveling when necessary and if possible. This course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students; students will work as a team and with the professor to report, write and produce stories.

    "ClassOverview": "Asian Americans comprise the fastest growing racial or ethnic group in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. More than 20 million Asians live in the U.S. and trace their roots to 19 groups in Asia. The Chicago region is home to an Asian American population that is ethnically, racially, culturally and economically diverse. South Asian businesses on Devon Avenue sell paratha and saris, and community centers support newly settled families. Shops in Chinatown on Cermak Road sell traditional herbal cures and non-profits focus on immigrant rights and health concerns. A volunteer-run school in the suburb of Des Plaines offers weekly Mandarin lessons to first, second and third generation Chinese-American families who hope their American-born children will stay connected to their roots. A Chicago improv troupe called Stir Friday Night, made up of up-and-coming Asian American comedians, has performed for more than 25 years.In this course, we will explore and produce stories of Asian Americans at a pivotal time in history. Asian American cultural, social and political influence is on the rise. Kamala Harris is the first Black and South Asian American candidate on a major party's presidential ticket. This summer, Minnesota native Sunisa Lee became the first Hmong American to participate in the Olympics and the became the first Asian American to win an all-around gymnastics gold medal. Still, while Crazy Rich Asians broke records at the box office and K-Pop topped U.S. Billboard charts, anti-Asian rhetoric, discrimination and attacks rose. Asian Americans are confronting their own bias and racism, as well. We will study journalistic works that explore the complex histories of Asians who have settled in the United States since before this nation's founding, the discrimination people faced and the opportunities they pursued. We will hear from and about Asian American journalists, activists, artists and leaders.This class is for anyone who wants to better understand the role of media and journalists covering communities of color. We will explore issues of identity, race and ethnicity, nationality and class. We will learn to report in and about communities with sensitivity, address cultural and language differences and practice journalism of empathy. We produce stories in a variety of media",

    "ClassOverview": "Sports marketing is an opportunity to use sports - and indeed entertainment - to explore some important marketing concepts that are utilized in many areas such as inconsistent product; loyalty; celebrity management; event execution; crisis interventions; sponsorships and partnerships; ticket pricing; social media and digital innovation; tie-ins between retail and teams.Much of the course concentrates on marketing and business. Some will take the course because they are passionate about sports and will use that sports interest to become deeper practitioners in the world of marketing and business, including theory, ethics, legal and financial considerations. Some won't be avid sports fans but will be interested in a well-rounded knowledge of marketing.Sports marketing is nuanced. It may mean how a team is marketed, but it may also mean how a soft drink uses a fan base to reach an audience. The course considers areas such as pricing and these issues translate to other fields so while sports may be how we study the subject, sports becomes the means to ensure that marketing and business understanding is accessible..Sports is a lens to learn because it delivers passion and excitement on a global basis and brings people together even during competitive moments. There are many job opportunities in sports marketing, from consumer product companies looking to attract fans to teams looking for storytellers.",

How might they stand in the way of public understanding of social difference?  Clearly, the media affect the way we see one another across social boundaries established by such characteristics as race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality.  How do the perspectives formed by this mediated reality ultimately affect our decisions on public policy in such areas as political participation, equal rights and criminal justice?  These and other considerations are central to professional journalism responsibility and enlightened public choice making.  Without question, the media are vital to the effective operation of our democratic system by providing information that should be free of the kind of bias that can distort the public participation process.Through discussion of principles of media professionalism and ethics, and an examination of some of the hot topics featured in today's headlines, this course will set a framework for recognizing and analyzing media narrative framing, as well as the representation of traditionally marginalized groups within that narrative frame. Ultimately, we will develop a deeper appreciation of media responsibility. Just as important, we will expand our sense of media literacy in considering a path forward whether as professional journalists or engaged citizens as we navigate the challenging terrain of an increasingly diverse society, one in which we all can appreciate the value of social difference and multiple perspectives.",

In this course, we'll look at the top innovators of this genre including AJ+, NowThis, NBC, Bloomberg, Vox and others and learn the best practices for social media video reporting. We'll also look at what's on the horizon as all of these news outlets face the ever-changing algorithms, audience tastes and new technologies that emerge to disrupt the status quo. The class is a combination of lecture/instruction, guests from major social media video news organizations, practice exercises and two story assignments. The final assignment will be produced on location in New Orleans during Medill Explores week. A key component of this course is to develop skills in the tools used to tell these stories - primarily by learning the applications in Adobe Creative Cloud, including PhotoShop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Effects.

With its sawgrass marshes, freshwater pools, and cypress forests, the Everglades is the largest wilderness area east of the Mississippi River and has defined the culture of the Seminole people for thousands of years. For the past 50 years, however, agricultural and stormwater runoff has degraded the quality of the Everglades and threatened the Seminole people and endangered animals including the Florida panther, American crocodile, certain species of fish and wading birds. The Seminole have launched an ambitious $65 million project to improve the quality and quantity of water flowing off their Big Cypress Reservation into the Florida Everglades. Over the past two decades the issue of tribal sovereignty has become increasingly salient, as Indigenous communities struggle to defend their air, water, and other natural resources; protect their access to traditional foods; and adapt to changes in their landscapes. The right of Native governments to insist that government-to-government relationships be honored by the states in which they reside a fundamental element of Indian sovereignty is at the cultural, political, and legal core of these disputes.",

    "ClassOverview": "The president of the United States is forced to resign. Evidence of genocide is unearthed. Tax money meant for the poor is pocketed by the people entrusted to help. In each case, investigative reporting has played an essential role, and over the years, it has proven to be one of the highest forms of journalism: shedding light on wrongdoing and exposing corruption at the highest levels. In this dynamic course grounded in real-time investigative reporting, students will expose a problem of significant national or international importance and chronicle its effects on the lives and livelihoods of those most impacted, particularly those in disenfranchised communities. Throughout the winter and spring quarters, students will take on one critical subject using the tools honed by investigative reporters: documents, data and sources. Students will dig deep and learn on the go, reporting on a complicated topic, synthesizing findings and writing or producing a compelling, long-form investigative story suitable for publication. In the past six months, students at the Medill Investigative Lab have published more than 15 stories in The Washington Post, focused on the impact of COVID-19 in America's nursing homes. The stories have prompted calls for investigations by members of Congress. The winter course is a primer: Working remotely, students will devote a tremendous amount of time digging for information and framing stories. In the spring, students will report out stories on the ground, traveling when necessary and if possible. This course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students; students will work as a team and with the professor to report, write and produce stories.

    "ClassOverview": "A Chicago police officer fatally shoots a teenager, but police refuse to release dash-cam video until a journalist invokes the Illinois Freedom of Information Act. A lawsuit accusing the Chicago City Council of violating open meeting laws is filed after reporters learn of private discussions on the city's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A journalist covering a protest over the death of George Floyd files a federal lawsuit accusing police of violating his First and Fourth Amendment rights for spraying him with a chemical agent. As these and other cases demonstrate, journalists in these contentious times need to turn to the law to confront increasing challenges to newsgathering and investigative reporting. This unique joint Practicum with Northwestern's Pritzker School of Law - comprised of externships and weekly seminars - aims to advance the public's access to information, to hold institutions accountable, and to defend free speech and press freedom.  Through externships of 10-12 hours a week at media organizations, non-profits, and press-advocacy groups (provided and matched by faculty), Medill students will learn how to research and prepare access requests and how to research legal or policy matters related to investigative and accountability issues. Through lectures and guest speakers, students will be introduced to the major transparency laws and other topics inherent in the relevant casework.  Working collaboratively with law students, Medill students will deepen their understanding of the subject matters, share their experiences on outside projects, and discuss the legal and ethical issues that arise.

The design of such systems, however, is not simply a technical question. In order to successfully create these systems, we need to understand how people work, play, and communicate with one another in a wide variety of situations. This course illustrates the practice of understanding human interactions that take place both with and through technology; and it explores the design, creation and evaluation of technologies to support such interactions. Course topics include: design processes, prototype construction and technology evaluation techniques. Specialized topics may include social software and collaborative systems, value-sensitive design, and agent-based technologies. No programming experience is necessary. There will be occasional labs to explain technical content. Course requirements include short hands-on exercises, two exams, and a group project.",

The current phase of globalization is primarily driven by economics forces leading to a world-wide integration of markets and finances and by technological innovations shaping mobility and connectivity in our knowledge-based world. The course begins by critically attending to a set of techno-economic features of globalization, and then addressing cultural and political issues that arise with globalization.  The course will focus on following four topics: the new dynamics of global production, the new dynamics of global marketing and consumption, the new dynamics of circulation and cultural economy, and the new geography of jobs and economic inequality. Since we live in a world primarily structured and propelled by global capitalism, we will (while discussing topics noted above) focus on a group of intriguing and powerful global corporations and their practices (both commercial and cultural): Amazon, Apple, Walmart, Uber, and others. The current phase of globalization (becoming dominant and noticeable in1990s) has been accompanied by a socio-political reaction called the anti-globalization movement.  This is not a monolithic movement.  It has many strands and differing agendas. This movement, in its initial phase was largely dominated by the activists from the political left.  However, in its current phase the anti-globalization movements in Europe and USA are often led by the political right as evident from BREXIT and the election of Donald Trump. We will also discuss this general topic.",

    "ClassOverview": "We live in an increasingly mediated world. From the ways we socialize with friends and family, to the way we engage in work and leisure, to the way we procure food media and technology play a key role in structuring our everyday lives and activities. In turn these media objects, and the messages which they communicate, play a key role in shaping our understanding of the social, political, and economic systems around us. But how, in what ways, and to what extent does media structure our social realities? And further, what role do we as individuals and as audiences play in both getting meaning from and giving meaning to the media messages?Throughout this course, we will attempt to answer these questions as we examine the way mass media messages get constructed, circulated, and repurposed throughout popular culture; as well as the way these media messages help structure popular understandings of ideology within society. Beginning with early theorization on the relationship between media and society and the concept of media effects and medium theory, we will trace the way theories about the relationship between mass media and the audience have evolved within the field of communications studies, from a one-sided theory of media effects, to a cultural exchange between the needs and wants of audiences as specifically-socially located agents. Throughout this course, we will also interrogate how media messages become popular' and what characteristics of media messages lend themselves to popular, pleasurable, and negotiated readings.In line with the goals of this Communications Studies 394 writing seminar, throughout the course students will also be learning how to go about conceiving, developing, and crafting their own original research papers. Students will engage in in-class peer review workshops and short writing assignments that will help guide them in the research and writing process. In addition, students will learn skills that they will be able to apply in their future academic work and writing.",

These collectives which we refer to as social movements are fundamentally communicative in nature. Movements are formed through communication and it is through communication that they achieve much of their strategic objectives. Moreover, movements are inextricably linked to communications channels. As media and communication technologies have transformed, so too have the structures and the practices of social movements. This course explores the complex relationships between communication and social movements, bringing together theories from communication studies, sociology, and political science, as well as tracing historically how social movements have developed new practices of achieving social change.",

Although cultural studies is now often treated as an intellectual trend easily relegated to the past, it is also true that the work of both scholars has continued to inspire countless others working in a range of different fields. The thinking of Williams and Hall is also undergoing something of a revival, as evidenced by constant references to Williams's generative concept, structure of feeling, and Duke University Press's recent publication of substantial portions of Hall's work. This course is designed to ask, then, what can Williams and Hall offer to the contemporary cultural analysis of media and print culture? However, by juxtaposing some of their essential work with that of Lauren Berlant, this course will also venture an alternative narrative about how cultural studies continues to develop as both an intellectual and political project, which places feminism, critical race studies, queer studies, and questions about subjectivity, affect, identity, and changing socio-political configurations at its heart.",

Experiencing the world through more than one language impacts not only communication with others, but also how one perceives and processes the surrounding environment. Converging evidence from the growing field of bilingual research reveals that learning, using, and managing two languages has profound consequences for linguistic, cognitive and neural function. Throughout this course, we will consider what it means to be bilingual, and explore how bilingualism shapes human communication, including language development and learning, the production and perception of speech, cognitive function, and neural activity. Every week, we will read about research and discuss theories, methodologies, and possible extensions in class. A key objective of this course is to give you a greater understanding and appreciation of the tremendous effect of language, as well as to practice reading, communicating and generating scientific research.",

We will also raise broader questions about the historical and social processes that shaped the historic transformation of yoga from a 5,000 year-old South Asian tradition into a modern cultural form. Finally, we will problematize yoga practices in the contemporary United States and address the complex ways in which it has become a contested space for cultural appropriation and socio-economic disparities in ways that exacerbate racialized and gendered hegemonies. There is no prerequisite for this course. Students will be asked to demonstrate their comprehension and knowledge of the material through participation, discussion, short quizzes, sequencing assignments, and a final project. Upon completion of this course, students will be familiar with traditional and emerging schools of practice, benefits and sequencing of poses, as well as the history and anthropology of modern yoga.",

To cultivate our artistic autonomy and agency, we'll then move through to more extended movement sequences which combine prompts: qualitative, dynamic, gestural, corporeal, musical, and improvisatory to delve deeply into more complex dancing.  As we work through the quarter,  we'll endeavor to hone critical our thinking, cultivate our problem-solving skills, and increase our overall understanding of creating and making together.

Indeed, human-beings are creatures who naturally think about the world in story elements and who rely on narrative structures in order to explain their surrounding world and the actions of those who inhabit that world. In various contexts, research has repeatedly demonstrated that engaging stories may be especially valuable as they facilitate processing of new, difficult, or controversial information, produce longer-lasting effects, and encourage adoption of story-consistent attitudes and behaviors.

    "ClassOverview": "Media Meet Technology emerged from conversations Fred Turner and I had during winter 2003. Fred wanted to expand from media studies into science and technology studies (STS), while I was embarked on the inverse intellectual journey, from STS to media studies. There was a burgeoning literature beginning to explore the intersection of these two fields, in particular on issues having to do with the development and use of information and communication technologies. However, it dawned on us that there was little in the way of a systematic attempt to think programmatically about that intersection across and beyond specific projects. Thus, to explore what that intersection might look like, Fred and I convened a series of panels at the annual meetings of the Society for Social Studies of Science (2003) and the International Communication Association (2004). Inspired by the discussions at those panels and in other venues and texts, I began teaching a doctoral seminar under Media Meet Technology title at Northwestern in fall 2005. Since then, various iterations of the seminar have focused on different issues, but a few elements have remained constant over the years: a) the presence of readings from media studies and STS, b) the combination of contemporary and historical scholarship; and c) the focus on the material and content dimensions of information and communication technologies. For the winter 2022 iteration the focus will be on Ethnographies of Media Practice Across the Americas. We will examine work on nine countries across the continent Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and the United States and pay special attention to cross-national patterns of similarity and difference in topical foci, theoretical framing, and argumentation structures.",

This in-depth course combines yoga practice with critical inquiry to engage this global phenomenon on multiple registers.

We will also raise broader questions about the historical and social processes that shaped the historic transformation of yoga from a 5,000 year-old South Asian tradition into a modern cultural form. Finally, we will problematize yoga practices in the contemporary United States and address the complex ways in which it has become a contested space for cultural appropriation and socio-economic disparities in ways that exacerbate racialized and gendered hegemonies. There is no prerequisite for this course. Students will be asked to demonstrate their comprehension and knowledge of the material through participation, discussion, short quizzes, sequencing assignments, and a final project. Upon completion of this course, students will be familiar with traditional and emerging schools of practice, benefits and sequencing of poses, as well as the history and anthropology of modern yoga.Required texts:Susanna Barkataki.

    "ClassOverview": "Since its inception, television has been central to American cultural diplomacy and global reputation. Audiences from all over the world met the expansion of American TV with both enthusiasm and resistance, and US program exports exceeded those of any other nation. Early television scholars equated the omnipresence of US TV with its cultural influence and objected to what they saw as cultural imperialism. By 1980s and 1990s, US television increasingly turned to international co-productions, as these projects carried both financial and cultural benefits. In contemporary televisual landscape, international co-productions, global television format circulations, and internationalization of streaming services reflect the increasingly transnational needs of the global marketplace. In this course, we will examine the dynamics and cultural implications of television's global reach.We will begin by tracing the rise of US television on a global scale from the Cold War to the contemporary moment. We will investigate how US television built a presence that extended across Western Europe into the communist bloc and the non-aligned nations of Asia and Africa, as well as the charges of cultural imperialism that this expansion triggered. We will analyze transnational program exchanges and trace the impact of traveling formats on diverse types of commercial and non-commercial television systems. The second part of the course will focus on the effects of technology on the globalization of television, with emphasis on streaming services and online content.",

    "ClassOverview": "Visual media has always had an intimate relationship with the domestic life of the family. What is widely considered the first known photograph, created by Joseph Niepce c. 1826, was the view out the window of his family home in Burgundy, France. Similarly, one of the earliest films ever made, the Lumi re Brothers' Le Repas de B b  (1895), shows Auguste Lumi re, his wife, and their child having breakfast at their home in the French countryside. And while the historical connections between visual media and family run deep, there is a new poignance in the role that familial media plays in our current climate. In the throes of civil uprisings and an ongoing global pandemic, familial media helps console the loss of loved ones, intervenes in isolation, and connects us with our communities despite enforced social distancing. This historical survey course on the ethics and theory of familial media situates our contemporary social media explosion in a long and rich tradition of visual media influencing what we mean when we talk about family.This course examines how identity, home, and broader notions of belonging have developed as a result of, and in response to, changing visual representations of the family. Starting with the Lumi re brothers' self-representation in Le Repas de B b , we will also critique the Lumi res' later ethnographic films that violently misrepresent Indigenous families from the Global South. We will examine home movies that produce nostalgia for family history alongside first-person documentaries addressing familial abuse and trauma. Analyzing the role an audience plays in the production of familial media, we will compare private video diaries addressing one's own identity formation with YouTube vloggers publicly circulating the minutiae of their everyday lives. Lastly, we will interrogate how social media provides new possibilities for visually representing changing notions of what family can and does look like today.",

Throughout the course, we will bring so-called seminal films from around the the globe in dialogue - and in fruitful collision - with contemporary and/or lesser-known works that challenge the so-called canon and resonate with related themes, philosophies, formal strategies, geographies, cultures, agendas, atmospheres, etc. We will place an emphasis on exploring the diverse possibilities of nonfiction films as well as on the politics and ethics of representation. Screenings and readings will be intensive and rewarding for both graduate students and motivated undergrads, and we will invite several filmmakers to join us in discussion of their work. Students will be asked to write short response papers and produce either a final research paper or a final media arts project in conversation with films viewed in class. Learning objectives include: to strengthen your understanding of a major strand in the weave of film history; to develop your strength and stamina as a film viewer; and to expand your awareness of the wide variety of social, political, cultural, aesthetic, and philosophical issues nonfiction filmmaking has wrestled with throughout its development.",

We will examine the social, cultural, and technological factors that have shaped the development of the recording industry, considering musical genres such as jazz, blues, rock, swing, tropicalia, country, ambient, dub, EDM, hip hop, and K-pop. We will consider the production, distribution, and reception of recordings, tracking the changing ways in which sounds have been produced, sold, and consumed. Recordings of popular music will be our primary focus, but we will explore synergies with the film industry, radio, television, digital games, and other digital platforms. Some of the key themes in the course will be the intersection of multiple sound industries; the tension between independent and major labels; questions of copyright and creativity in popular music; struggles for diversity and inclusion in the music industry; the relationship between technology and innovation in sonic arts; and the increasing mobility and cultural ubiquity of recorded sound. Looking back across a century of sound allows us to gain a deeper appreciation of our current immersion in recorded music, and to better understand some of the central debates and dynamics that have shaped the recording industry.",

This class will locate the phenomenon of Bollywood cinema within the rich and complicated history of Indian cinema since the Partition of 1947, when the British colonial administration divided the region into the sovereign nation-states of Pakistan and India. We will take mainstream Indian film as a key site for reflecting on the politics of nationalism, globalization, and forms of social belonging. We will begin with Indian cinema's reflections on the affective and political aftermath of the Partition. We will then move into an analysis of the formation of gendered citizenship, generic modes, and regional film industries. In the final unit of the course, we will address the transnational circulation of Indian cinema and the rise of Bollywood as a global brand, as well as the explosion of contemporary experimental documentary and video art, which circulate in art galleries and film festivals abroad.We will put pressure on the boundaries between popular cinema and parallel cinema, investigate the role of film in social life, and address the differences of class, race, gender, and ethnicity in the construction of the filmic text.",

We will consider how film and other moving image technologies have reflected historical moments and shaped cultural discourses in modern Japan. Focusing on films that raise disciplinary questions related to both the cinematic medium and Japan, we will examine, among other topics, the era of silent cinema; the relationship between nationhood and the formation of a national cinema; technological transformations and the coming of sound; the wartime period; cinema during the occupation; and 1950s modernism.

This course will develop basic skills in designing dramatic and dynamic relationships between performers and camera through hands-on exercises in class and shooting in the field. You will introduce and practice different styles of coverage (for example, long-take vs. analytical montage) and camera technique (dolly vs. handheld vs. tripod).

Beginning with the roots of sound branding, from early radio jingles and network chimes, through to today's rich landscape of marketing channels, digital products, and voice devices, this class will explore the art and science of sound branding. Our guide will be Steve Milton, the co-founder of Listen, a NYC-based sensory experience company, and a pioneer of this emerging field. Mr. Milton's lectures on the current state and future of sound branding will be our point of departure for a series of readings, listenings, experiments, discussions, and design assignments. The two largest projects involve the end-to-end creation of a brand's sound design, and creating a speculative sound design for a product of the future.",

Screenings will be augmented by written material as we consider crucial questions circulating in the non-fiction realm. We will reflect upon whose stories are being told, by who, and to what end. We will examine the structure of particular films and how stylistic choice underscores or subverts content. And finally, we will look at traditional versus post-pandemic possibilities for financing, viewership, and impact.",

Readings will explore production, storytelling, identity and distribution of TV and web entertainment. Students will watch, analyze and have the option to pitch or produce television. The goal of this course is to give students a deeper understanding of the complexity and ever-changing nature of a media business. Television is arguably the country's most powerful medium, foundational to American culture and history in the post-WWII era. At first tightly regulated and controlled, television has fragmented, its networks folded into conglomerations and its programs spread across dozens of channels. Throughout the semester students are encouraged to question how changes in television production, regulation and distribution affects programming, culture and politics at large.",

We will discuss audience engagement, distribution, and outlets (streaming, broadcast, and brick-and-mortar) and interview programmers who work for festivals, movie theaters, micro cinemas, and cinematheques. Students will come away with insights about festival strategy for their own films and a solid understanding of the distribution and exhibition phase, allowing them to navigate that landscape more successfully as media makers and potentially as programmers.

Screenings and readings will be intensive and rewarding for both graduate students and motivated undergrads, and we will invite several filmmakers to join us in discussion of their work. Students will be asked to write short response papers and produce either a final research paper or a final media arts project in conversation with films viewed in class. Learning objectives include: to strengthen your understanding of a major strand in the weave of film history; to develop your strength and stamina as a film viewer; and to expand your awareness of the wide variety of social, political, cultural, aesthetic, and philosophical issues nonfiction filmmaking has wrestled with throughout its development.",

We will ask which key themes from the original texts these artists carry forward into their adaptations and how those themes implicate culturally-specific issues.

In this course students will engage with theatrical works, performance art, and social media to develop research and analytical skills that can be applied across diverse artistic and scholarly contexts.

In the second half of the course, students will examine how production decisions made by the director, actors, and designers transform the same script without changing a word. This will include digging into how a production itself sustains meaning making, methods for researching artistic intent, and ways to think about the relationship between process and product. Along the way, students will learn how to use various kinds of sources to support their analysis and practice writing skills that will prepare them to compose their first analysis paper on a production or play of their own choosing.

This course looks at science fiction as vital to how we imagine our future and our present. We will explore topics including space travel, environmental disasters, and the redefinition and disruption of what it means to be human (including concepts of sex and gender). In this class, we will explore some of these works, as well as considering larger questions of genre and form. The course will be organized thematically, rather than historically. Classes will usually revolve around one or two important themes of the genre explored through a wide variety of plays with science fiction elements.

Voice work will focus on extending vocal range and expanding resonance to support Shakespeare's use of heightened text.  Diction work will continue the use of IPA to enable students to discover Shakespeare's extensive use of alliteration and assonance in both verse and prose.Students will also work on speaking while in motion and sharing space with other actors, combining relaxation and physical flexibility while performing a shared group piece from one of Shakespeare's plays. In addition, each student will work on an individual sonnet an individual monologue, and a two-person scene to be presented, memorized,  in a final performance before an audience.",

    "ClassOverview": "This class takes the image of the Victorian table-top puppet theater and asks the student to create and perform their own 7-10 minute production in 10 weeks.  This is a rigorous experience of precise visual storytelling.   Because of its economy, the form demands explosive metaphorical imagination joined with a disciplined approach to making materials work, arranging the procession of the images and orchestrating how the story unfolds.  The stage is in miniature, and so anything truly is possible pigs can fly, roses can bleed.  An empty stage is available to each artist, they can choose a myriad of things to fill it with, arrange it as they like, and tell the story of their choice.  In light of this much freedom, the student needs to make strong choices about the aesthetic path they are going to take.  The form exposes any kind of vagary, sloppiness, lack of cohesion and generality.  Because students are working alone on this project, they alone must make those choices and commit fully to their own vision. This is most valuable because directors and designers must own their own point of view about the world and the story they are telling, and they must be able to defend it using visual metaphor.  A theater artist must also solve theoretical problems with a practical art, and that is what Toy Theater teaches.  In it you are everything from playwright to architect, technical director to sound designer.  Have fun.",

The course will explore how by staging, funding, and shaping the narratives of theatrical performance, states in the Caribbean and the Southern US were invested in performing and cementing new identities that were influenced by pan-African identities, workers' movements, black nationalism, white supremacist holdovers of the antebellum era, and a rejection of colonial values. These often contradictory impulses mirrored the turmoil of the social climate that gave birth to these works.

This course will explore black theater and theatre making from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century. As a class we will excavate how the stage (and performance more broadly) have provided avenues of both radical and quotidian expression for black American subjects during this time period. From the early dramas of abolitionists to the revolutionary theater makers of the early 20th century, black theatre has always provided a critical ground to challenge the terms of personhood, subjecthood and citizenship for black people in the US.  In this course we will combine critical theory with historical analysis, literary close reading, and archival studies to attempt to define, explore, and understand the critical work of black theater making. The objectives of the course are to give an introduction to the strategies and breadth of African American theatre and performance. The syllabus is designed for an advanced undergraduate major, with preference for enrollment given to theatre majors, juniors and seniors, although all students are welcome to enroll.",

Staging, or the arrangement and movement of performers on camera, is the key area of collaboration between directors, actors and cinematographers and perhaps is the most essential element of visual design in cinema (necessary even before lighting and editing can do their expressive work). This course will develop basic skills in designing dramatic and dynamic relationships between performers and camera through hands-on exercises in class and shooting in the field. You will introduce and practice different styles of coverage (for example, long-take vs. analytical montage) and camera technique (dolly vs. handheld vs. tripod). This class develops skills necessary for actors, directors, cinematographers, and is also highly recommended for students focused on editing and sound recording.",

Students in this advanced writing class will workshop a complete draft of a play that is approximately 60 pages in length (the page limit will be expanded if the play is chosen for additional workshopping in the spring quarter). The full draft will be read out loud in class and MFA and advanced undergraduate directing students will workshop and present scenes from the play. Students will serve as actors during the reading and workshopping of the play. Playwriting students will be expected to workshop a recent work. An older project may be workshopped if it has undergone significant revisions. This is the first part of a two part class. The second part is a production class which will run in the spring (likely Thursdays 11am-150pm). Four plays from part one of the class will be selected to receive workshop productions in part two. This will culminate in a weekend festival in June where the produced plays will be showcased. In addition to second and third year graduate directors, this class is open to undergraduate Junior and Senior advanced directing students by permission only.  Your participation in New Play Collab I will automatically guarantee you a spot in New Play Collab II in the Spring, where you will direct a workshop of one of the selected plays for the New Work Festival.  Please only apply if you can commit to taking the course both Winter and Spring quarters.

    "ClassOverview": "Adolescence is often referred to as a period of storm and stress (Hall, 1904). Yet there has been considerable critique of stress as the defining feature of adolescence, and recently researchers have focused on the many strengths, assets, and opportunities of adolescents and this developmental period (National Academies of Sciences & Medicine, 2019). The experience and consequences of stress do, however, represent important features of adolescence, as well as early adulthood. While complete coverage of the extensive literature on adolescent and young adult stress is not possible, in this course, we will begin to explore some central questions: Why are adolescence and early adulthood stressful periods of life? Are they more stressful now than in the past? How do we define and best measure adolescent and young adult stress? What are the key sources of stress during these developmental periods? What are the major biological stress response systems of the body, and how are they impacted by stress and normative developmental change? What are the implications of stress, and biological stress responses, for adolescent and young adult health and developmental outcomes? What factors reduce adolescent stress and its impact on youth outcomes? How might this knowledge be leveraged to develop and implement interventions to improve the wellbeing of adolescents and young adults?This course is an advanced, interactive, undergraduate class in which the instructor and students explore this set of questions (and more) together, through lecture, readings, and discussions. An additional aim of the course is to familiarize students with key research methods and quantitative analyses used in adolescent stress research. Students will have the opportunity to pose their own questions and hypotheses regarding adolescent stress and examine these hypotheses empirically (based on available data). Ultimately, the joint goals are to a) teach students about the science and current knowledge regarding adolescent stress, b) have students begin to get comfortable posing and answering questions using data analyses, and c) to help reduce student stress through increased understanding of stress and factors that contribute to and reduce stress.",

At the same time, there is complexity in such collective and social action, and organizational life is often marked by a number of recurring and difficult problems. The purpose of this course is to help students understand the complexities of organizations.  It is designed to provide an exposure to theories of organization, important organizational issues and processes, and a variety of strategies and tactics useful to successful organizational leaders and followers alike.",

    "ClassOverview": "Organizations are ubiquitous. For most of us, our initial encounter with the world is in an organization - a hospital, and then most of us spend the bulk of our childhood and adolescences in another organization - a family. We spend much of our childhood and adolescence also attending yet another organization - the school. Most Americans still work in an organization as distinct from being self-employed. Organizations are a fixture in our lives at an early age and continue to play a central role across the lifespan. The ubiquity of organizations is such that we often take them for granted, rarely stopping to consider how they influence our lives. Organizational change has garnered considerable attention from academics, private consultants and policy-makers. This interest cuts across organizational sectors for-profit, non-profit, and government organizations. This class focuses on organizational change. Studies in Organizational Change is an advanced course in the Learning & Organizational Change major designed to introduce students to key constructs and ideas about change in organizations. The class is organized as follows: We will begin with a discussion of the notion of change in general and organizational change in particular. We will identify different levels of analysis that scholars who study organizational change focus on. We will then examine different levers or resources for organizational change including - leadership, routines, human capital, social capital, technology, culture, identity and organizational environments. Throughout the class, students will be expected to constantly apply the constructs and ideas to particular cases of organizational change.",

You'll conduct ethnographic fieldwork, using concepts and methods drawn from theories of human cognition as it happens in context. These concepts come from distributed cognition and actor-network approaches and stress the inextricability of humans and non-humans (i.e. tools, technologies, representations) in the conduct of everyday organizations. The broad goal is to equip you with strategies for making organizational change that can be applied across personal, professional, and community. Course readings are varied and include literature from cognitive science, sociology, anthropology, design, and other disciplines.

For example, access to fresh food is often limited in some urban areas, as is access to health care.  Understanding and redressing these issues therefore often requires the use of maps and mapping technologies.  In this course, we will explore the use of spatial analysis to address problems and opportunities of diversity and inclusion.  Students will learn to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to create maps to understand and analyze these issues, and to suggest solutions.  Gaining familiarity with GIS therefore will be one of the major outcomes of the course.

The coursework is intended to support you through readings, large-group discussions, and analyses that inform us about practitioner research and inquiry. The courses are also designed to support your research through smaller instructor research groups and other experts in assessment, who will provide more in-depth opportunities for discussion, analysis, and feedback as you continue your own project.  In general, students will use the instructors, peers, and other practitioner/research experts for the duration of the Master's Project sequence.In the second course of the three-course Master's Project sequence (MSHE 407) students will learn skills and techniques for collecting original data. Data collection methods include surveys, interviews, observation, and artifact/archival analysis. Students will then create a data collection plan and begin to gather data.",

What counts as fact vs. opinion vs. belief and so on; who gets to decide and under what conditions? How is knowledge produced and how does it gain traction?  How does the source and type of knowledge interact with socio-political-cultural constructs and systems of power and, in turn, how can knowledge be used to produce and/or perpetuate power and privilege or to empower those who are marginalized? Finally, how does what we do in SESP and at Northwestern as both consumers and producers of knowledge fit within the landscape of these questions?In this course students will explore these and other questions to gain insight into the social production, distribution, consumption, interpretation, and operationalization of knowledge. Using primarily seminar-style discussion, the first portion of the course focuses on building and analyzing theoretical frameworks and applied texts in order to generate a working understanding of knowledge in its myriad forms.  Among our goals for the first portion of the course is to tie theoretical,  academic, and folk knowledges to everyday experiences and the world around us writ large.  The second portion of the class will involve a series of applied of cases studies, including welcoming members of the SESP faculty community to present on their research, which we will work to bring into conversation with our generated frameworks regarding the sources, types, and implications of knowledge.",

How can we realize human rights and secure civil rights in our communities and around the world? We will attempt to answer these questions by exploring specific steps of the design and implementation process. By examining characteristics of youth and community programs in the fields of education, social justice, human development, health promotion, human rights, and civic engagement - at the local, national, and international levels - we will seek to identify commonalities and understand differences among them. A key goal of this course is to acquire an intellectual and applied understanding of the principles of program design and development, which include a sustained consideration of issues affecting the quality of program implementation. Considerable attention will be devoted to specific steps within the design and implementation process, as well as case studies of actual programs. We will examine a range of topics, including: finding inspiration; identification, recruitment, and retention of target audiences; staff selection; setting global and incremental goals; and ensuring sustainability. We must also acknowledge that what counts as a social need or social problem is subjective and complex and that programs can therefore be controversial, difficult to manage, and difficult to evaluate. In light of this, we will touch on the organizational, ethical, and political contexts of implementation. While much of the design and implementation process can be seen as intuitive, you are encouraged - through class discussion, your writing, and your designs - to actively challenge your assumptions about creating community programming, as well as critique the programs that we learn about and the design techniques that we practice.",

    "ClassOverview": "We live in a world awash with data, and it's often difficult to know which information and results to believe and which to dismiss. The purpose of this course is to help students to become better and more discerning consumers, disseminators, and producers of quantitative data. My hope is that you will leave this class feeling empowered - with the language, conceptual tools, and confidence to call bullshit when appropriate, and in turn to feel more confident that what you believe to be true really is likely to be true.This is a participatory class. Our work together will be to bring in examples we find from the world around us and discuss them. There are no prerequisites for this class except for an eagerness to engage - to find examples of quantitative data, to examine them critically, to share them with the rest of us, and to discuss one another's ideas.Because most of the work of the course is about looking for examples and discussing them, there won't be much in the way of formal reading. We will read Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West's paperback Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World (Random House, $18), labeled as BW in the schedule of classes. But I expect that you will read widely and bring examples to class for discussion.",

More precisely, we will focus here on historical and contemporary issues of equity in education based upon the divisions of American society according to presumptions around what race means, i.e. what it tells us about who and how people are. Through our 1) generous listening & dialogue, 2) critical analyses of empirical & theoretical data and 3) deep thinking & writing, we will wrestle with a number of ideas and perspectives. Yet, central to this course is knowledge of the myriad, though sometimes nuanced ways that racism has and continues to operate as a tool of exclusion, disenfranchisement and violence towards individual persons and communities. Equally important, are the intellectual, sociopolitical and pedagogical efforts of individual and collective entities to resist, persist and thrive in the face of injustices.",

    "ClassOverview": "Social policy is integral to the fabric of society. It helps to determine who has access to resources and services, regulates how those are obtained, and is constantly negotiated by changing ideas about public need and the common good. A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation.The first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents.",

    "ClassOverview": "The gap between rich and poor is significantly larger in the United States than it was 40 years ago. In this course we explore why this may have happened and what policies have been attempted to address the causes and consequences of inequality. We will investigate these questions through the lens of economics, and will learn fundamental economic concepts as a way to answer these questions. The first part of the course will begin with a discussion about what inequality is and how to measure it. We will discuss how inequality in earnings, wealth, and wellbeing have changed in the U.S. over time, and will talk about various economic theories to explain these changes. The second part of the course will explore policies designed to address the causes and consequences of inequality. We will also learn about fundamental economic concepts - including opportunity cost, comparative advantage, supply and demand, human capital, and individual responses to incentives - as a way to critically examine the effectiveness of these policies. The final part of the course will focus specifically on inequality along race and gender lines, with some attention to whether these differences are the result of discrimination. We will also explore how economic thinking can help us analyze policies designed to address past and present discrimination.",

We will gain deeper understanding of the ways education policy shapes practice in American public schools through a combination of field experiences and scholarly reflection, often using Chicago as a touchstone for our inquiry and analysis.As you prepare for this course, consider some of the questions we will need to ask in order to understand what makes schooling in cities unique. What is urban education, exactly? Who is educated in urban schools? Is everyone educated equally? As we begin to answer these questions, we will investigate current issues in urban education such as school choice, school closure, standardized testing and equity initiatives, developing the ability to analyze the multiple and contested factors that influence urban education in the US.",

This writing class explores how we have defined, pursued and, at times, attained happiness. We ask the question: is happiness a goal or a journey? We examine how the ideal of happiness finds expression in our culture through philosophy, art, literature, music, and film. We also explore social phenomena such as the quest for higher education, the explosion of the self-help industry, and the ebb and flow of our consumer culture.The course is conducted completely online.

We explore different methods of interpreting narrative in terms of genre (What happens to us as readers when we place a text in a specific genre, such as the detective story or Great American Novel? How do generic expectations work on our interpretive experience?); aesthetic form (What do we mean when we call a writer's prose beautiful or a plot well-constructed? How do literary standards work to constitute values?); and ideological content (How do we judge a text's position in relation to historical and contemporary political issues, including-but not limited to-matters of gender, race and class?). Our focusing lens is the theme of criminality: What counts as transgression against norms, both within texts (Who are the criminals? Who makes the laws? What are appropriate punishments for crimes?) and in our wider literary culture (What makes a text worthy or not worthy of being considered literature? Who makes these literary laws?) As an introductory seminar and requirement for English majors, the course focuses deeply on the composition and revision of effective literary arguments.This course was formerly ENGLISH 298.",

Inspirations will include Sonali Deraniyagala, Claudia Rankine, Alex Haley, John McPhee, Lillian Ross, Gabriel Mac (n e Mac McClelland), Maxine Hong Kingston, Oscar Hijuelos, and Lindy West. Writing assignments will range from weekly exercises to workshop submissions.The emphasis, of course, will be to get you writing and writing well by focusing on structure, technique, and style. At the same time, we'll go beyond the printed page to explore how technology and the internet have changed the longstanding traditions of creative nonfiction. Many of our discussions will center on how the publishing landscape has shifted with the advent of e-books, literary websites, and digital-only magazines. In both workshop and seminar, we'll consider how that has transformed the way we read and (must) write narrative and non-narrative forms. Subgenres covered will include audio life stories (such as StoryCorps), radio essays (such as This American Life), and digital essays (such as those by Claudia Rankine and John Lucas).We'll also discuss how the internet and social media can serve you in your career.

We will explore human behavior from a biological, psychological and socio-cultural perspective. We will discuss the history of psychology beginning with an overview of psychology's roots, observing how prevailing paradigms have shifted throughout the centuries. We'll then discuss how to think like a social scientist, with an attitude of open mindedness and skepticism, as we observe people in different social settings. Discussion will include the tools and methods that are used by social scientists to formulate their questions and propose answers. With the tools of neuroscience we will explore the biological underpinnings of mind and emotions and how they influence behavior. We will seek to understand and have empathy with individuals suffering from psychological disorders ranging from mild depression to severe psychosis. Discussion will cover ways to diagnose psychopathology and therapies that have been proposed to heal such internal suffering. Practical skills for coping with stress and emotions will also be explored. Finally, we try to uncover group dynamics that can give rise to pathological and sometimes destructive behavior as that observed in cults. The course will conclude with a theme of malleability that challenges assumptions about how we perceive, remember and think. Carries social science credit.",

We will review how media and cultural theory have been used to make sense of and critique reality television. We will engage concepts such as documentary ethics, surveillance, interactivity, lifestyle, taste, labor, and identity. Through emphasis on the diversity and complexity of reality television, we will approach the genre as both a provocative element of and a reflexive commentator on contemporary American culture. Reality TV is the best and the worst. Drawing on theoretical literature and personal experience, we will also consider how and why the genre inspires such intense reactions.

Due to their complexity, definitive explanations of organizational structures, processes, and outcomes have been difficult to achieve. This course provides an overview of what is known about complex organizations. Students are introduced to various theoretical paradigms that explain different aspects of organizational life. They learn how to use theoretical models to analyze organizational problems. Solutions to problems are suggested by the various research studies that provide a knowledge base for this course. By the end of the course, students will be able to diagnose organizational problems and devise targeted remedies.This course is conducted completely online.

    "ClassOverview": "This course focuses on connected political and social movements--both within the MENA region and between movements outside of it--alongside the aesthetic forms those movements and solidarities produced and sometimes shared. Specifically, this course helps us think critically about the long history of solidarity politics and forms as well as their future, and even about the terms solidarity and aesthetics themselves.What can we learn from historical examples of connected movements in order to understand the way in which allegiance and disidentification are articulated through multiple aesthetic platforms and modalities?  What can aesthetics teach us about the possibilities and limits of shared imaginations and political aspirations? Additionally, we ask how activists, artists, and scholars mobilize the aesthetic and the linguistic to address tensions in translocal solidarities between national or local specificities and singularities on the one hand, and shared or cognate experiences and structures on the other? Are solidarity and aesthetics even the most accurate or desirable terms to describe such diverse movements as they exist in the history of connected struggles across the long 20th century (from third worldism of the mid-century to more contemporary actions such as DecolonizeThis Place/BDS)?Our investigations will bring us to study literary texts, manifestos, journals, art works and projects, scholarly debates, and films emanating from or concerned with the formerly (or still) colonized regions of the Middle East.This class includes a professionalization component in that it culminates in a symposium of 20 minute presentations from all class members, the texts of which are to be handed in for graded assessment which feeds into final grades, otherwise equally based on class participation and contextual research presentations. A significant majority of materials will be available in English, but language skills in Arabic and/or French would be helpful.",

    "ClassOverview": "The defining research method of ethnography is participant observation with living interlocutors. Ethnographic understanding emerges through human exchange and collaborative meaning making, both between the anthropologist and research participants (participation) and between individuals in the field of investigation or fieldsite (observation). What does it mean, then, to do ethnography in the archives? Archives -- inscribed traces of lived worlds left by people - seeming cannot speak back to the reader. Without this lived exchange, what can we learn from documents created historically for administrative purposes of states or colonial empires? In this graduate seminar, we consider both narratives of state domination through text creation and possible stories about actions of individuals in non-dominant social groups, especially women, children, the poor, and ethnic minorities. Rather than adopting purely an anti-empirical approach to archived texts, we consider ways in which the bureaucratic scribe's record is both situated fact and angled purpose, and how documents' potential stories exceed their intended purposes. Theoretical and conceptual readings frame case studies from the MENA region including Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Egypt, Turkey, and Morocco. Students write and workshop original research papers from an archival corpus of their choice.",

    "ClassOverview": "Black classicism is the study of black scholars, writers, and artists who deliberately engage with and extend of the classical tradition as well as the creative and intellectual production by those scholars and writers. Michelle Valerie Ronnick coined the term Classica Africana in 1996 to describe, in short, the influence of classical studies on people of African descent. Classica Africana includes those in the nineteenth century who studied and read classical literatures and languages, Greek and Latin, the students of standard formal American education as influenced by the British liberal arts system, neoclassical or black classicist writing, and, to a lesser degree, the traces of classical literatures common to popular memory.This course introduces the long history of Black Classicist literatures. Since Phillis Wheatley's Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral (1773), the very first publication by an African American in the United States, black writers have engaged with classical works by Greek and Roman authors. During this class, we will read selections from Black Classicist writers and the referent texts (in translation). We will explore the variety of fiction and poetry from Phillis Wheatley, Ovid, Pauline E. Hopkins, Charles Chesnutt, Euripides, as well as more recent work by Toni Morrison, Donika Kelly, and Kwame Dawes & Matthew Shenoda. As a class, we will create our own set of unique inquiries and explore the answers to, at least, the following questions: How do the classics inform the stories by African American authors? What kinds of capital do classical themes, plotlines, and symbolism create for Black classicist writers? What assumptions can we make about Black authors who rewrite classical works? In what ways are those assumptions affirmed and exploded through our semester-long literary inquiry? In what ways does Black classicism alter the way we understand the classical texts to which it refers?Assignments include regular online discussions, a mid-term paper, a group presentation, and an individual or group final project and presentation. Students will be evaluated on their performance in these assignments as well as class attendance and participation. As a primarily discussion-based class, class preparation and participation are essential for success. This seminar depends on discussion and participation of every member of the class.",

This course will explore black theater and theatre making from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century. As a class we will excavate how the stage (and performance more broadly) have provided avenues of both radical and quotidian expression for black American subjects during this time period. From the early dramas of abolitionists to the revolutionary theater makers of the early 20th century, black theatre has always provided a critical ground to challenge the terms of personhood, subjecthood and citizenship for black people in the US. In this course we will combine critical theory with historical analysis, literary close reading, and archival studies to attempt to define, explore, and understand the critical work of black theater making. The objectives of the course are to give an introduction to the strategies and breadth of African American theatre and performance. The syllabus is designed for an advanced undergraduate major, with preference for enrollment given to theatre majors, juniors and seniors, although all students are welcome to enroll.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course introduces students to a variety of works by Black women writers since Phillis Wheatley. At this moment, the notion of the Black woman writer may not seem anomalous or unusual. However, it was only a short time ago in history that to be a Black woman writer meant to be considered an aberration. Thomas Jefferson wrote that Phillis Wheatley's poems were beneath the dignity of criticism. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., suggested that Jefferson and a panel of white men held an official trial to interrogate the authenticity of Wheatley's work. These men would have never imagined that conference sessions, entire books, and countless critical articles would be dedicated to this foundational black woman writer: the very first black author to see their work published in the United States. We mark the beginning of Black published letters in the US with Wheatley; and it is within this tradition that we will consider the similarities and differences in content and forms by the women writers that we will read during this course.In this class, we will survey a wide range of Anglophone Black Diaspora women authors and primarily concentrate on the United States. Our authors will include Toni Morrison and Phillis Wheatley, as well as Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, Octavia Butler, and others. We will read poetry, short stories, essays, and at least one novel by these and other authors.Assignments will include at least regular online discussions, a group presentation, and an individual final project.

Today there are six major companies that control much of what people read, hear and see. Those firms are AOL-Time Warner, General Electric, Walt Disney, News Corporation, Viacom/CBS, and Bertelsman. This course will examine the monetary forces that are driving the industry away from its primary mission of information. Critics contend that the drive for higher ratings, circulation and web page clicks is coming at the expense of the quality of news on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the Internet. Charges of Fake News combined with the ever-diminishing number of news providers is threatening democracy by limiting the number of voices that can be heard in our society.",

What do all of these have in common? They are all teenage rites of passage. Drawing from anthropological and sociological case studies, we will examine various rites of passage experienced by teens in the U.S.  In analyzing these rites, students will become conversant with theories of ritual, contemporary surveys of teen demographics and cultural trends, media and cultural studies. We will examine teen popular media and consumption related to rites of passage as well as historical literature on the rise and development of the American teenager as a cultural phenomenon. Students will be asked to generate original research for their seminar final project, applying the tools from the course to a case study of their own choosing. This seminar will make use of multimedia materials and will feature multi-source digitized media viewing, analysis, and some mediamaking as part of course assignments.",

Through engagement with a variety of digital resources including maps and digital media, we will learn how the environment of what is now the United States was managed by Indigenous people before and throughout colonization, how Indigenous people have been impacted by the environmental policies of the United States, and how Indigenous resistance and activism have shaped both the environmental movement in the U.S. as well as contemporary Indigenous political thought. In discussion, we will break down the politics, economics, and ethics of this history, challenging ourselves to think critically about the land we live on and its future.

    "ClassOverview": "The History of American MedicineWhy does American medicine look the way it does? The United States spends more on health care than any other country in the world, but is almost singular in its lack of universal health care. American medicine is at once distinguished by its capacity for research and innovation and by its inability to resolve the profound health inequalities that shape this country. Which historical processes produced this unique set of circumstances? When and how have activists, patients, and politicians agitated for change? What alternate futures might we imagine? This course traces the history of American medicine from the nation's founding to the present day. We will learn about the formation of the medical profession, track changing understandings of health and disease, discuss the development of drugs and medical technologies, and investigate the role of professional organizations in combatting efforts to nationalize healthcare. At the same time, we will hear about efforts to reform American medicine in the name of anti-racism, gender equality, decolonization, disability rights, and social justice. By studying these complex histories, we will ask questions about the relationship between health, power, bodies, and knowledge and consider what it has meant to provide care and pursue health throughout American history.",

    "ClassOverview": "Modern Jewish American Literature: Ethnicity, Assimilation, PerformanceThis seminar consists in modern Jewish American literary text analyses in point of their cultural markers, focusing on the relations between collective and individual memory, mainstream and minority tensions, as well as identity and ethical dilemmas. We intend to focus on the ethnic components of these texts as evidence of cultural assimilation, dissimilation, or performance on the part of the authors who produced them in the U.S. The seminar looks at identity as a contextually based-fluid category, the result of spaces of negotiation. We will compare the representation of Eastern European Jewish experiences in the early twentieth century literature of immigrant authors from the Russian Empire and Romania to the representation of the same early twentieth century experience by contemporary (Jewish) American authors. We will assess how significant moments in the life of early twentieth century Eastern European Jews in America (such as the fusgeyer / marching emigration movement from 1900 Romania, the 1903 Kishinev pogrom from the Russian Empire, the original Bintel Brief/Bundle of Letters column in The Yiddish Daily Forward or the 1911 Triangle Fire in New York) were represented in early twentieth century literary works and how they are represented in contemporary, twenty-first century literary works. In this sense, we will consider the input of the gender lens and various literary genres (play, reportage poem, graphic narrative, travelogue, photo-word novel) looking back on the early twentieth century. We will analyze literary works by Eastern European Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from the Pale of Settlement and Romania at the turn of the twentieth century (Abraham Cahan, Mary Antin, Anzia Yezierska, M.E. Ravage) and literary works rewriting the early 1900s immigrant experience due to contemporary (Jewish) American authors (Liana Finck, Margot Singer, Leela Corman, Jill Culiner, Barbara Kahn, Aleksandar Hemon, Robert Fink, Julia Alekseyeva). By examining moments of struggle and power imbalance in the relation between mainstream and minority groups, the seminar also explores the fundamental role of literature in mourning and historical reparation.",

This course is a hybrid of the research seminar and the writing workshop, and we will confront the challenges of both researching and writing in a collaborative manner. To that end, some of our sessions will be devoted to reading and responding to one another's work. While it can be difficult and intimidating to publicly present your work, and to publicly critique or question another's work, we will undertake both in the spirit of support and assistance in the hopes of creating a community of researchers, writers, and scholars. Becoming a careful reader, responder, and recipient of constructive criticism are invaluable skills that fundamentally inform the process by which virtually all scholarly work is produced.",

But cities are a relatively recent phenomenon in history. Further, history demonstrates that cities are not essential for human survival. The question then arises: why cities?This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the city. Some of the questions we will discuss in this course include: What is a city? How did cities develop? How do cities function socially, politically, and economically? What are some of the major social issues facing cities in the twenty-first century? In this course we will approach a wide range of cities across time and space. Chicagoland will feature prominently in our discussions. Drawing broadly on scholarship in anthropology and other disciplines, we will examine the characteristics of urban life in human history, from the first experiments with urbanization 6,000 years ago to contemporary global cities.",

    "ClassOverview": "Often, anthropology is talked about as the study of human culture, where it originates, how it is transmitted, how it changes. But what is culture? Rather than a universal, one-size-fits-all answer, anthropologists today seek to understand how ideas and actions interact within specific social contexts. Through a focus on ethnography, the fundamental method of our field, students will learn how to conduct research into the processes that shape the social world, emphasizing human agency in relation to sociohistorical, economic, political, and environmental forces. A key feature will be to denaturalize notions such as common sense, reinterpreting what we might know from our own contexts, as a starting point to understand others. Students will have the opportunity to practice anthropological research through multiple possible modalities, both face-to-face and online.",

And yet, peace continues to serve as a framework for many forms of global engagement, from international activities at elementary schools to humanitarian action and high-level diplomatic negotiations. The anthropology of peace takes seriously all these levels of aspiration for peace and seeks to identify divergent loci of peace and peace-building in today's complex world.The course offers a broad survey of anthropological approaches to peace, including ethnographic studies of peaceful societies, cultural mechanisms for dispute and conflict resolution, compensation, truth and reconciliation commissions, the relationship between peace and commerce, and the role of literature, art and material culture in peace activism. In this survey, we will be introduced to a variety of concrete efforts to foster peace and peaceful relationships. The course will also include two special events featuring examples of global peace activism.",

We will identify historical ideologies embedded in understandings of colonization in the Caribbean, the struggle for Indigenous rights in the Andes, and radical political thought in the US, and find points of intersection between them. We will consider their impact in subject formation by attending to their social, political, and economic effects. Because a monopoly over truth (and especially historical truth) has been central to the forms of power and authority that undergird ongoing systems of neocolonialism, we will consider the actors and institutions that develop, codify, and transmit notions that individuals as members of different social collectivities believe to be true. What can we learn about how truth settles, and thus unlearn some of the exclusionary practices embedded within the production of knowledge? The course will seek to develop a methodology that pairs linguistic and discursive analyses with basic ethnographic approaches. Focus topics will include colonization, social media, and governance.",

A major research trend adopts a comparative, cross-cultural framework to try to understand and explain commonalities and differences, which this course explores. Did the first complex territorial states we call empires emerge and develop in similar ways? What factors or institutions were crucial to their trajectory and success, and what theories have been proposed to account for them? What are the benefits and challenges of a comparative, multidisciplinary perspective, and what new kinds of histories might it produce? Many recent investigations compare Rome and Qin/Han China; others consider the historical sequence of empires in the Middle East, such as the Neo-Assyrian and Achaemenid Persian empires; still others analyze characteristics of imperial formation and rule in historically unrelated empires in different geographical regions and eras.This course examines selected case studies drawn from a wide geographical and chronological range, with special focus on the ancient Mediterranean and Middle East. We will examine different aspects of territorial expansion, consolidation, and rule, including state ideology, bureaucracy, cosmopolitanism, urbanism, borders and frontiers, religion, and the creation and circulation of the imperial image.

Across the world, states use monuments and archaeological artifacts to present national narratives in museums, ancient sites, and online platforms. In the Americas, nation-states have controlled who has access to the material remains from the past while transforming buildings, historic places, monuments, and artifacts into national patrimony. In the process of creating national patrimony, nation-states often estrange Indigenous communities from their landscapes and their cultural heritage.In this course, we will examine the role of archaeology in the creation and preservation of national identities in the Americas from the 18th century to the present. In weekly readings and discussions, we will learn about the institutionalization of archaeology as a state-sponsored discipline, the development of archaeological sites as national monuments and tourist destinations, the display and interpretation of artifacts in museums and heritage sites, and the monopolization of tangible cultural heritage by the state. Ultimately, we will evaluate the intersections of identity and politics throughout the history of Latin America.",

Examining these core dimensions of the sub-field will provide a strong understanding of how cultural anthropologists conceptualize their subjects/objects of study in relationship to the shifting terrains in academia and national and global political economic processes. Throughout, we will address the larger stakes both ethical and political of taking particular ethnographic and theoretical approaches.

Ethnographic understanding emerges through human exchange and collaborative meaning making, both between the anthropologist and research participants (participation) and between individuals in the field of investigation or fieldsite (observation). What does it mean, then, to do ethnography in the archives? Archives -- inscribed traces of lived worlds left by people - seeming cannot speak back to the reader. Without this lived exchange, what can we learn from documents created historically for administrative purposes of states or colonial empires? In this graduate seminar, we consider both narratives of state domination through text creation and possible stories about actions of individuals in non-dominant social groups, especially women, children, the poor, and ethnic minorities. Rather than adopting purely an anti-empirical approach to archived texts, we consider ways in which the bureaucratic scribe's record is both situated fact and angled purpose, and how documents' potential stories exceed their intended purposes. Theoretical and conceptual readings frame case studies from the MENA region including Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Egypt, Turkey, and Morocco. Students write and workshop original research papers from an archival corpus of their choice.",

The second half of the course will focus on the issues raised by the return to representation in painting, by photography and other technologies of reproduction, by new media and genres like video art and installation, by shifts in concern regarding audience and public art, and by increased pluralism and globalism and their impact on our definitions of mainstream and avant-garde.No prerequisites.

    "ClassOverview": "Performance Art has always been tied to acts of resistance. Coined in the USA in the early 1960s, Performance Art refers to the visual artists, poets, filmmakers, dancers, and musicians who gathered together to make Art that fell outside the parameters of the traditional art making practices of painting, drawing, and sculpture. In both form and content, these performances embodied and reflected progressive social and political agendas.  Downtown New York City, in particular, served as a hub for such boundary-crossing performative actions. These sites of creative encounter can be called Queer, as they were open, porous, and inclusive, allowing for artists to make space both physically and conceptually to empower and validate themselves and others. In this course we will explore artists, such as Yoko Ono, Yvonne Rainer Vito Acconci, Charlotte Moorman, John Cage and Merce Cummingham who engaged with a variety of Performance Art techniques beginning in the 1960s, such as happenings, events, and Fluxus concerts. Overall, this course aims to speak to a history of performance where the foundational principles of generosity, kindness, and collaborative exchange allowed for artists to be political while simultaneously fostering community and solidarity.",

They played many variations of the exquisite corpse game, they combined collaged elements, ink blots and drawing, they incorporated chance operations, they engaged in automatic drawing, they turned text into images, and they invented drawing techniques using frottage (rubbings), fumage (drawing with smoke), Rayographs (photograms) and decalcomania (image transfers). In this course, we'll experiment with many of these techniques and, in the Surrealist spirit, we'll try to come up with some of our own. The Surrealists' approach was more often characterized by an anything goes embrace rather than by heady criticality or judgment, and this course will focus more on doing and exploring than critique.Open to undergraduate students only.",

A major research trend adopts a comparative, cross-cultural framework to try to understand and explain commonalities and differences, which this course explores. Did the first complex territorial states we call empires emerge and develop in similar ways? What factors or institutions were crucial to their trajectory and success, and what theories have been proposed to account for them? What are the benefits and challenges of a comparative, multidisciplinary perspective, and what new kinds of histories might it produce? Many recent investigations compare Rome and Qin/Han China; others consider the historical sequence of empires in the Middle East, such as the Neo-Assyrian and Achaemenid Persian empires; still others analyze characteristics of imperial formation and rule in historically unrelated empires in different geographical regions and eras.This course examines selected case studies drawn from a wide geographical and chronological range, with special focus on the ancient Mediterranean and Middle East. We will examine different aspects of territorial expansion, consolidation, and rule, including state ideology, bureaucracy, cosmopolitanism, urbanism, borders and frontiers, religion, and the creation and circulation of the imperial image. Readings will represent contributions by scholars working in different disciplines, including history, art history, and archaeology.",

The course focuses on sustained, close engagement with art objects in the collection of the Art Institute and the methods and questions such inquiry raises. Seminar meetings will include portions devoted to discussions of assigned readings led by two university professors and others focused on active engagement with objects in the company of curators and conservation scientists. Although there are four primary instructors for this course (the two university professors, the director of research at the Art Institute, and an Art Institute conservation scientist), it relies on the contributions of a host of other Art Institute colleagues who will introduce students to the complex workings of a major public institution and the ways in which object-focused research is conducted in such a setting.",

Specifically, this course helps us think critically about the long history of solidarity politics and forms as well as their future, and even about the terms solidarity. and aesthetics themselves.What can we learn from historical examples of connected movements in order to understand the way in which allegiance and disidentification are articulated through multiple aesthetic platforms and modalities?  What can aesthetics teach us about the possibilities and limits of shared imaginations and political aspirations? Additionally, we ask how activists, artists, and scholars mobilize the aesthetic and the linguistic to address tensions in translocal solidarities between national or local specificities and singularities on the one hand, and shared or cognate experiences and structures on the other? Are solidarity and aesthetics even the most accurate or desirable terms to describe such diverse movements as they exist in the history of connected struggles across the long 20th century (from third worldism of the mid-century to more contemporary actions such as DecolonizeThis Place/BDS)?Our investigations will bring us to study literary texts, manifestos, journals, art works and projects, scholarly debates, and films emanating from or concerned with the formerly (or still) colonized regions of the Middle East.This class includes a professionalization component in that it culminates in a symposium of 20 minute presentations from all class members, the texts of which are to be handed in for graded assessment which feeds into final grades, otherwise equally based on class participation and contextual research presentations.

    "ClassOverview": "AY 2021-2022 In August 1947, as the sun set on Britain's Indian empire, the subcontinent was partitioned into two newly-created, independent nations: India and Pakistan. The division into two territories -one Hindu-majority, the other Muslim-majority - was accompanied by perhaps the largest migration in human history. Millions moved from one territory to the other, often against their will, as hundreds of thousands were killed in the ensuing chaos. The unprecedented violence of Partition - physical, emotional, social - profoundly shaped the national identities of India and Pakistan, permanently restructured the texture of everyday life and altered the global political order. From the subsequent partitioning of Pakistan and Bangladesh in 1971, to enduring border disputes in Kashmir, from ongoing cross-border migration to unresolved conflicts over identity and belonging, Partition continue to shape the region today. Partition's legacy today extends far beyond the heavily-fortified frontier and into the art, literature and popular culture of the three countries that emerged from it. Even as the post-colonial states treated Partition as an aberration best forgotten - a footnote of a midnight tryst with destiny - the arts emerged as the primary space in which the meaning of Partition was negotiated and mediated. What could not easily be engaged directly found its expression, often allegorically, on the silver screen or the off-white pages of literary magazines. This class will examine how Partition has been engaged in literature and popular culture, moving from contemporary depictions from the 1940s to its continued invocation in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh today. We will read/watch these texts alongside the extensive body of scholarship on Partition from History, Anthropology and Gender Studies with particular attention to the historiography of Partition and South Asian nationalisms. Throughout, we will engage with the idea of Partition as an event and ask how Partition continues to inflect life in South Asia and beyond today.",

We will then move into an analysis of case studies that focus on specific circumstances where Buddhist rhetoric, scriptural authority, and religious practices have played a role in violence including suicide, terrorist-related actions, and self-immolation predominantly in pre- and modern Asia. Some of the provocative questions that this course asks include: Why and how is religion involved in politics? Is Buddhism a pacifist religion? How does religion rationalize violence? How can some Buddhist leaders embrace terror as a political tool? Are the recent practices of self-immolation in Tibet acts of violence? Can non-violence be violent?",

In East Asian religions, such questions have been answered with reference to a variety of different concepts of fate, fortune, and karma. These concepts shape not only how people have viewed the world, but also how they have made their way through life. This class focuses on religious approaches to questions of destiny in premodern East Asia. We begin by studying Indian Buddhist ideas of karma and early Chinese notions of fate and fortune preceding Buddhism's arrival in China, then turn to the ways people in China and Japan negotiated these various concepts over the many centuries following the arrival of Buddhism. In the end, we discover important throughlines amid the diversity of religious responses to the problem of destiny in East Asian history.",

We will ask how we know what we believe we know about Asian culture where our knowledge of Asia comes from why we might critique existing ideas about Asia, seek to produce new or different ones, and how we might go about doing so. Concretely, we will focus on developing scholarly research practices: how to describe research topics, articulate research questions, and identify primary materials through which to explore them; how to find, read, evaluate, and make original use of existing scholarship; how to use library research to frame and inform the analysis of primary cultural materials; and how to communicate the aims and results of research to a community of peers. We will also discuss fundamental methodological problems faced by all scholars in the Asian humanities, and consider how those problems might inform and enrich our own research. The Senior Seminar is centered on individual student research projects, developed progressively in a workshop setting. Students are expected to begin the course with a clear research topic (or multiple possible topics) and a rough idea of what primary sources they may use to develop it. Over the course of the quarter, each student will develop their research topic into an original 12-15 page research paper. For students who wish to complete a Senior Thesis in ALC, this paper will provide the core of the thesis, to be more thoroughly elaborated over the rest of the year.

In particular, the realm of the invisible which includes the components of a radio telescope, the fascinating history of radio astronomy, and the numerous discoveries over the last 90 years (e.g., pulsars, quasars, signatures of early universe, organic molecules). This course is offered for undergraduate students who have no background in astronomy, physics or radio astronomy. The course assignment involves making posters on different radio astronomy topics. Posters will be exhibited in the main library in the Spring quarter.",

    "ClassOverview": "A course is offered for upper level (sophomore, junior or senior) undergraduate physics and engineering students who have no background in astronomy. Radio and optical astronomers view the sky with their respective telescopes and see something very different. In this course, we will explore the realm of the invisible which includes: the components of a radio telescope, interferometers, the fascinating history of radio astronomy, and the numerous discoveries over the last 90 years (e.g., pulsars, quasars, cosmic microwave background radiation, organic molecules). Radio observations of the sky have been instrumental in the development of GPS, WIFI, NASA's planetary missions and state of the art radar and radio receiver technology since the birth of radio astronomy.We are all familiar with radio frequencies by listening to FM radio stations and using GPS satellites fornavigation. Radio astronomy is the study of natural radio emission from celestial objects at frequencies outside FM and GPS frequencies. The radio band is very broad, spanning 100,000 Hz between 107 to 1012 Hz, whereas our eyes are only sensitive between red and blue, a factor of two. We cover how radio waves are received or transmitted by radio telescopes and discuss how data reduction is carried out in radio astronomy.",

We will learn how plants make food, move around to new places, reproduce, deal with extreme weather, and defend themselves against natural enemies. We will investigate the partnerships plants form with other groups of organisms, such as those with animal pollinators, fungi, and animal body guards. We will consider how plant form and function relates to global biodiversity patterns and contributes to the healthy functioning of ecosystems everywhere. Finally, throughout all of these topics, we will consider how humans use plants as sources of food, fiber, shelter, medicines, drugs, and more.",

The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector.  The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements.  Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector.  To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management.  Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.  The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.  The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.  This course is an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, learn and apply a new set of skills and knowledge while impacting the community.",

The rules of the game during this period have changed radically in terms of corporate control, business management and wealth creation. We will explore the transformations in business and commerce during the past four decades that have led to current trends and problems.Students interested in the recent history of Wall Street, financial markets, and business culture will enjoy this class. It will also appeal to students intrigued by late 20th and early 21st century American society - specifically how business and American industries have influenced America's identity. Those who may want to explore a career in business should find the seminar helpful in preparing for many types of professions across disciplines.Students will be exposed to topics such as leveraged buyouts, junk bonds, venture capital investing, the Internet Bubble, entrepreneurial management, hedge funds, and derivatives. In addition, we will explore public policy trends around issues including corporate takeovers, technology transfers, risk management, government bailouts and business investment. A common theme throughout the quarter will be how capitalism has evolved over the past few decades, and how this has changed the mindset of business professionals and the American workforce. It will be up to you to determine if this evolution has been beneficial or detrimental to American society.This will not be a seminar grounded in heavy technical economic and financial analysis or market theory. You will not need an academic background in economics to understand the topics of the class. No pre-requisites are necessary.Because students are not expected to have previous knowledge of these topics, the reading list is significant. Students are expected to complete readings prior to class. Please refer to the reading list for primary texts that will be used for the class.

Conversely, social justice is the process of enacting change to address persistent social inequalities. In this course, we will examine a number of contemporary issues through a social justice lens, and investigate how different modes of action can be employed to address social inequalities. The first half of the course considers several contemporary social justice issues in the Chicago area. We will likely consider the issues of segregation, gentrification and urban development, police violence, and public school funding (these topics are subject to change depending on student interest and scheduling concerns). For each issue, we will discuss recent policies, conflicts, or controversies and place them in historical context. In doing so, we will practice assessing the power relations and social inequalities embedded in each issue. During the second half of the course, we will learn about different forms of collective action that seek to enact structural social change. Specifically, we will consider the ways in which non-profit and advocacy organizations, community organizing, movement politics, and electoral politics are or are not able to address social inequalities. Throughout the course, students will be invited to reflect on the social inequalities and modes of action that they encounter in their internships. Together, the course readings, discussions, and assignments are designed to help students develop the capacity to critically consider social inequalities and different modes of action to address them.",

Your internship over the next 10 weeks will help you to get a handle on that by actually working. But actually working in the context of your internship is in many ways a partial view of what you're in for. Not all jobs are the same, nor is all work; and work environments change over time, as do their meaning to us as individuals. Paired with your internship, then, the aim of this course is to fill in these gaps. This course is an invitation to engage with the concept and practice of work critically so you can better situate your internship and your work beyond Northwestern.

Students will examine behaviors of individuals and institutions, analyzing how those actions contribute to the success or failure of a sustainable and environmentally just future. Students will use various forms of media to communicate their findings to the Northwestern community and beyond, culminating in student-directed projects and presentations.",

    "ClassOverview": "Stimulated by current interest in decolonization and globalization, the study of ancient empires is now thriving. A major research trend adopts a comparative, cross-cultural framework to try to understand and explain commonalities and differences, which this course explores. Did the first complex territorial states we call empires emerge and develop in similar ways? What factors or institutions were crucial to their trajectory and success, and what theories have been proposed to account for them? What are the benefits and challenges of a comparative, multidisciplinary perspective, and what new kinds of histories might it produce? Many recent investigations compare Rome and Qin/Han China; others consider the historical sequence of empires in the Middle East, such as the Neo-Assyrian and Achaemenid Persian empires; still others analyze characteristics of imperial formation and rule in historically unrelated empires in different geographical regions and eras.This course examines selected case studies drawn from a wide geographical and chronological range, with special focus on the ancient Mediterranean and Middle East. We will examine different aspects of territorial expansion, consolidation, and rule, including state ideology, bureaucracy, cosmopolitanism, urbanism, borders and frontiers, religion, and the creation and circulation of the imperial image. Readings will represent contributions by scholars working in different disciplines, including history, art history, and archaeology.",

We will ask questions at the very heart of literary studies: what is literature and what are its uses? What can we learn from literature about contemporary concerns such as feminism, racism, empire, or postcoloniality? How do human beings exist in language and imagine different worlds through it? How does language shape human experience, subjecthood, and identity? We will survey debates about these questions in the criticism of the past as well as in recent, cutting-edge theory, emphasizing modes of reading critically in relation to dynamics of race, class, gender, and sexuality. While the readings in this class will mostly consist of theoretical texts as opposed to literature, we will read the theory itself as a literary object, thus blurring the lines between literature and its criticism.This course serves as an introduction to the major in Comparative Literary Studies, but it is open to all students who are serious in their curiosity about literature, language, and the human condition.",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar consists in modern Jewish American literary text analyses in point of their cultural markers, focusing on the relations between collective and individual memory, mainstream and minority tensions, as well as identity and ethical dilemmas. We intend to focus on the ethnic components of these texts as evidence of cultural assimilation, dissimilation, or performance on the part of the authors who produced them in the U.S. The seminar looks at identity as a contextually based-fluid category, the result of spaces of negotiation. We will compare the representation of Eastern European Jewish experiences in the early twentieth century literature of immigrant authors from the Russian Empire and Romania to the representation of the same early twentieth century experience by contemporary (Jewish) American authors. We will assess how significant moments in the life of early twentieth century Eastern European Jews in America (such as the fusgeyer / marching emigration movement from 1900 Romania, the 1903 Kishinev pogrom from the Russian Empire, the original Bintel Brief/Bundle of Letters column in The Yiddish Daily Forward or the 1911 Triangle Fire in New York) were represented in early twentieth century literary works and how they are represented in contemporary, twenty-first century literary works. In this sense, we will consider the input of the gender lens and various literary genres (play, reportage poem, graphic narrative, travelogue, photo-word novel) looking back on the early twentieth century. We will analyze literary works by Eastern European Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from the Pale of Settlement and Romania at the turn of the twentieth century (Abraham Cahan, Mary Antin, Anzia Yezierska, M.E. Ravage) and literary works rewriting the early 1900s immigrant experience due to contemporary (Jewish) American authors (Liana Finck, Margot Singer, Leela Corman, Jill Culiner, Barbara Kahn, Aleksandar Hemon, Robert Fink, Julia Alekseyeva). By examining moments of struggle and power imbalance in the relation between mainstream and minority groups, the seminar also explores the fundamental role of literature in mourning and historical reparation.",

    "ClassOverview": "This class will take a look at the life and work of the groundbreaking Viennese psychologist Sigmund Freud from a comparative and interdisciplinary angle. Almost 80 years after his death, Freud's legacy continues to be controversial: some claim that his theories are no longer relevant in the light of new research, whereas others defend his theories and/or expand upon the implications and influence of his ideas, in the realm not only of psychology, medicine, and neuroscience, but also in the fields of sociology, cultural studies, philosophy, literary studies, criminal justice, queer and gender studies, communications, and many more. What is certain, however, is that, one way or another, Freud's theories and ideas have marked the world for all time.

Storytelling has been a staple of Italian literature and culture since the days of Boccaccio, but the aesthetic, ethical, and cultural aspects of the genre certainly have changed in the last century.  Can the modern short story still communicate ethical and social truths?  Is the inherent, conclusive brevity and elegance of the genre paradoxically better able to capture the chaos of contemporary life?We will examine works written in a realistic mode and in a fantastic style.  Moreover, we will discuss the elements that define the two approaches with an emphasis on close reading and on the historical and social context of each text.  We will focus in particular on issues of love, jealousy, sexuality, gender, friendship and youth culture as defined by Boccaccio, Verga, Morante, Ortese, Pavese, Calvino, Tabucchi and Tondelli.",

    "ClassOverview": "Movement and circulation are literature's perennial themes. Yet, the ways in which these motifs are generated through writing differ significantly across time and space. In the same way that our political and social discourses on circulation and migration shift according to changing political social and historical conditions, so do their literary inscriptions. In this course, we turn to these ever-present motifs in Francophone African literary writings and cinema. We clearly cannot exhaustively explore all the rich possibilities of this theme, given the time limit of a quarter. However, the works chosen will expose students to both a broad historical and political framework and geographical expanse. We will begin with migration and movement in the colonial era and move forward in time. We will also travel from West Africa to North Africa and the Indian Ocean in order to explore the modalities of movement and circulation in their political, historical, and geographical contexts. The literary and cinematic corpus of the class is robustly supported with theoretical and historical materials and lectures. Movement also hints at the affective and emotional charge of circulation, be it understood as migration forced of voluntary return, or simply as travel. The modalities of affects linked to movement will constitute an important dimension of our analyses.",

    "ClassOverview": "(Neo)realism and the Documentary Impulse: Italian cinema has changed the way in which we conceive of the moving image and its relationship to reality in its social, political, and affective dimensions. This course begins with the heyday of Neorealism in the 1940s (Rossellini's war trilogy, De Sica's Bicycle Thieves, and Visconti's The Earth Trembles), placing this defining moment in film history in the context of World War II and the break from the Fascist period. Particular attention will be devoted to questions of gender and race, as the memory of Italy's racial laws and colonial past in Africa was about to be dimmed by the cultural politics of postwar recovery and, later, the economic miracle. Mindful of this process of historical erasure, we will then turn to the remarkable production of the 1960s and 1970s and analyze they way in which different directors (Fellini, Antonioni, Visconti, Rosi, Pasolini) treated the problems of modernity and industrialization, migration, organized crime, and the media industry. Finally, we will assess the return of a documentary approach to reality in films like Garrone's Gomorra (Gomorrah, 2008) and Rosi's Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea, 2016) in the context of the current socio-economic crisis and the resurgence of populism and right-wing politics. Throughout the course, we will also work to acquire the critical and methodological tools necessary to analyze film as a complex mode of cultural production.",

Focusing on films that raise disciplinary questions related to both the cinematic medium and Japan, we will examine, among other topics, the era of silent cinema; the relationship between nationhood and the formation of a national cinema; technological transformations and the coming of sound; the wartime period; cinema during the occupation; and 1950s modernism. We will also study the place of important individual directors - Ozu, Mizoguchi, and Kurosawa - within the broader economic and institutional contexts of Japanese cinema and its global circulation.

Our focus will most often be on the manifestos and essays in which anticolonial writers outlined their literary and political programs, but we may also look at a few poems, stories, and films.This course will be taught in conjunction with parallel courses offered at the University of Chicago and the University of Kentucky.

    "ClassOverview": "Gender, Race, and Aesthetic Resistance in Film and Media: This course will focus on films, TV programs, and music videos that expose and attempt to counter the formation of gender and race hierarchies in the fabric of daily life. Our point of departure is Italy's current predicament, which sees the resurgence of right-wing politics and a widespread homophobic and racist stand. Several anti-immigration policies and the recent rejection of the Zan bill (which was meant to make violence against LGBT people and disabled people, as well as misogyny, a hate crime) urge us, yet again, to contest still enduring images of Italy as the land of love and of Italians as basically brava gente (decent people). We will begin by considering the ways in which mass media have contributed to construing gender and race stereotypes at different junctures in Italian history, keeping in mind the longstanding repression of Italy's colonial past in Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. However, the bulk of the course will be devoted to those practices of cultural resistance that developed within commercial film/television production as well as in more lateral or experimental contexts. Among the examples we will consider are Pier Paolo Pasolini's queer documentary, Comizi d'amore (Love Meeetings, 1964); Cecilia Mangini's Essere Donne (Being Women, 1965), a feminist take on Italian Marxism and anthropology; Adriana Monti's Scuola senza fine (School without End, 1983), produced in the context of the experimental 150 hours course; Gianikian and Ricci-Lucchi Dal Polo all'Equatore (From the Pole to the Equator, 1985), which re-edits archival footage of colonial travel and sport from the Fascist period; and contemporary works by Afro-Italian writers and artists such as Gabriella Ghermandi, Dagmawi Yimer, and Karima 2G. We will conclude by addressing the resonances between Afrofuturism and feminist poetics in the US and Italy.",

We explore comparatively both the connections to the Latin American and European literary traditions that saw his figure emerged and also to the many debates that his literature helped define: What constitutes a literary text? What is an author/authority? How to write/read literature in the age of the mass media? How does literary translation inform cultural translation? What cultural traditions can the Latin American writers claim as their own? Starting with his 1920s poetry Fervor de Buenos Aires and his relation to Martin Fierro avant-garde group, we move into the core of his Fictions stories, El Aleph, El Sur, The Library of Babel,  to finally discuss programmatic essays, such as The Argentine Writer and Tradition.  The bibliography on Borges is vast and rich, so we accompany our reading of Borges' fiction with secondary readings that focus on providing a historical, cultural and specifically literary context.",

The four primary texts for the seminar are, therefore, Baumgarten's Mediationes philosophicae de nonnullius ad poema pertinentibus (Philosophical meditations on something more than nothing pertaining to the poem), the introduction to Hegel's Vorlesungen cber  sthetik (Lectures on aesthetics), Heidegger's Ursprung des Kunstwerks (Origin of the artwork), and Benjamin's Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter des technischen Reproduzierbarkeit (The Artwork in the age of its technical reproducibility).  Other ancillary and secondary works will be also be considered, depending on student interest and the direction of the conversation.

While readings and discussions will gravitate toward contemporary Marxist and post-Marxist ecological thought (including the afterlives of ideas like primitive accumulation and metabolic rift in recent feminist, anti-colonial, and environmental frameworks), we will also spend time looking at the writings and influence of earlier thinkers whose controversial materialisms have returned to critical attention in recent decades (e.g. Lucretius, Spinoza, Herder). A guiding aim of the course is to assemble a fuller sense of the historical and conceptual underpinnings of first-world environmentalism; so we will ask what matters, and to whom, in part by putting greenness under scrutiny as a critical category.

    "ClassOverview": "This course focuses on connected political and social movements--both within the MENA region and between movements outside of it--alongside the aesthetic forms those movements and solidarities produced and sometimes shared. Specifically, this course helps us think critically about the long history of solidarity politics and forms as well as their future, and even about the terms solidarity. and aesthetics themselves.What can we learn from historical examples of connected movements in order to understand the way in which allegiance and disidentification are articulated through multiple aesthetic platforms and modalities?  What can aesthetics teach us about the possibilities and limits of shared imaginations and political aspirations? Additionally, we ask how activists, artists, and scholars mobilize the aesthetic and the linguistic to address tensions in translocal solidarities between national or local specificities and singularities on the one hand, and shared or cognate experiences and structures on the other? Are solidarity and aesthetics even the most accurate or desirable terms to describe such diverse movements as they exist in the history of connected struggles across the long 20th century (from third worldism of the mid-century to more contemporary actions such as DecolonizeThis Place/BDS)?Our investigations will bring us to study literary texts, manifestos, journals, art works and projects, scholarly debates, and films emanating from or concerned with the formerly (or still) colonized regions of the Middle East.This class includes a professionalization component in that it culminates in a symposium of 20 minute presentations from all class members, the texts of which are to be handed in for graded assessment which feeds into final grades, otherwise equally based on class participation and contextual research presentations. A significant majority of materials will be available in English, but language skills in Arabic and/or French would be helpful.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course takes its point of departure from a careful reading of The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt's massive study of Nazi totalitarianism and its origins in anti-Semitism and European imperialism.  For the first three weeks of the class, we will read the three sections of the Origins along with a selection of Arendt's contemporaneous writings on issues at the heart of her study: wide-scale statelessness and forced migration; racism and imperial expansion; totalitarian propaganda and the holes of oblivion.  Arendt recognized that the Origins posed a question that remained unanswered in that work:  faced with the manufacture of living corpses, what preserves our humanity and redeems our actions?  Arendt's next major work, The Human Condition, thus moves toward an analysis of the conditions and modes of human activity:  from the biological life process, to the world-creating capacity of homo faber, to the urgency and fragility of human action.  As we read The Human Condition, which seeks to answer the question posed by the Origins by accounting for what European philosophy has generally failed to analyze with sufficient clarity namely, the dimensions of the active life we examine Arendt's attempt in the same period to review and, in her own way, deconstruct the concepts of thinking around which the ideal of a contemplative life concretized.  This prepares us for a reading in the final weeks of the seminar of Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she re-conceptualizes evil as a certain implementation of systematic thoughtlessness.   As we examine these three major works, each of which is a reflection on the relation between language and politics, we will continually attend to the varying ways in which Arendt sought to understand where poetry stands in relation to human conditionality, and we will use her often-neglected suggestions in this regard to develop an Arendtian poetics.",

In particular, we explore the literary and visual culture vanguard practices as they migrate from metropolis into significant transfer points through travel, exile, translation, exhibitions, intellectual correspondence, thus fostering international aesthetic movements. We pay special attention to how avant-garde artists and writers negotiated foreign influence and local conditions; and how these movements conceived themselves as profoundly local while speaking in an international idiom. We will also contrast the historical avant-garde period of 1920s with its resurgence in the 1960s and the politics of counter-culture movements.

    "ClassOverview": "World War II was clearly the most important single event of the twentieth century. However, the seeds for World War II were laid in World War I, making it necessary to study both wars. We will study both why these wars occurred and why they turned out the way they did. In asking why wars turned out the way they did, we will emphasize the size and performance of the economies involved, and such issues as why the U.S. and Soviet Union produced so much while Germany produced so little. In the last part of the course, students will have a chance to do independent research on any aspect of World War II which interests them, economic, political or military.",

First, profit-seeking firms may try to reduce competition through price discrimination, resale price maintenance, entry deterrence, predation, horizontal mergers, vertical integration, or collusion. We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, cable television, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of winner-take-all markets, in which bandwagon effects result in convergence to a single operating system, recording technology, or social network. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate. We will analyze the ideal scope of artificial monopoly rights and the natural tension between intellectual property and antitrust law. Throughout the course we will explore the general topic of regulation and industry cases, both current and historical.",

The economic approach to law assumes that punishments such as incarceration or fines are implicit prices for violating the law. According to this view, these prices may be chosen in such a way that will yield the most socially desirable outcome. Of course, it may not be appropriate to judge laws entirely based on their economic efficiency. For example, it may also be appropriate to consider outcomes that are fair or just, however defined, and these outcomes may not be the most efficient. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that efficiency is one important criterion for purposes of judging the law. Given that economists are often interested in studying incentives, it is therefore quite natural that we might be both interested and perhaps even well-equipped to analyze various areas of the law. Along these lines, we will seek to employ simple economic models in order to understand the efficiency of laws in several areas, including torts, contracts, property, and crime. In studying these diverse areas of the law, the economic approach to understanding the law will be consistent throughout, and will allow us to study these different areas of the law in a unified manner.",

Given that economists are often interested in studying incentives, it is therefore quite natural that we might be both interested and perhaps even well-equipped to analyze various areas of the law. Along these lines, we will seek to employ simple economic models in order to understand the efficiency of laws in several areas, including torts, contracts, property, and crime. In studying these diverse areas of the law, the economic approach to understanding the law will be consistent throughout, and will allow us to study these different areas of the law in a unified manner.",

    "ClassOverview": "This is an introduction to issues in urban and regional economics. We will study the problems of cities, urban areas, and regions by examining the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance. Typically, this will involve reading the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of the papers to get a general overview of the contribution, research question and methodological approach.  We will analyze data using Stata or R and may also use ArcGIS, a digital mapping program.",

We'll study representations of bad women by male authors including the weird witches and murderous noblewoman of Shakespeare's Macbeth as well as the work of rebellious women writers themselves, such as Lady Mary Wroth, the heretic Anne Askew, and Queen Anne Boleyn. We'll also keep an eye our own times by asking what bad girls of the Renaissance might teach us about female rebelliousness today, regularly comparing 16th- and 17th-century representations with 21st-century examples ranging from Rihanna's Bad Gal Riri persona, to recipients of the villain edit on RuPaul's Drag Race, to the reimagined lives of controversial Tudor queens in the musical SIX.",

    "ClassOverview": "The essayist Michel de Montaigne once observed, when I am playing with my cat, if I have my hour to begin, or to refuse, so has she hers. Many of our habits of thought presume an absolute difference between humans and all other creatures. The idea of the human/animal divide constantly re-appears, despite the way evolutionary models show community of descent. But a closer look at writers across history shows how a persistent, cross-species curiosity works in the other direction to attribute allegedly human powers to non-human creatures. Are we anthropomorphizing other creatures when we see likeness or symmetry between us? Or are we counting ourselves as an animal among other animals? On the other hand, when we see differences between us and them, why should that difference normally be in our favor? This course takes up the core philosophical problem of self and other in what may be its most dramatic case. By looking across species - and analyzing human writers who work hard to do the same - we'll develop interpretive methods to reveal the infrastructure of a given text and to develop strong humanimal readings of our own.",

    "ClassOverview": "Far off places, daring sword fights, a prince in disguise. Not simply enchanting or magical fantasies, fairy tales emerged from oral storytelling traditions to reflect cultures' deepest desires and darkest fears.  Fairy tales offer us characters onto whom we can project our own fantasies or anxieties as well as narratives that we can interpret - and reinterpret - across time periods and places to help us understand personal and cultural moments.  This course will investigate the theme of transformation in fairy tales and myths to ask questions about identity, gender, sexuality, and our relationship to the environment.  We will explore not only how fairy tales represent cultural investments, but also how fairy tales cross boundaries to offer critiques of societal norms.  For instance, the genre of feminist fairy tales reworks traditional stories to critique patriarchal structures and privilege female agency.  At the same time, we will ask how fairy tales and myths - which so many of us have been immersed in since childhood - shape the lens through which we see the world and the narratives we tell ourselves about our lives.  We will juxtapose modern retellings with traditional tales of transformation from Ovid's Metamorphoses, Arabian Nights, Charles Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Andersen.  And, of course, we will analyze adaptations of fairy tales in film, from Disney's animated Beauty and the Beast and Frozen to The Shape of Water and Into the Woods.",

    "ClassOverview": "This reading-intensive first year seminar will consider how colonialism and contagion together produce racialization in science fiction. In the year of the pandemic, European nations voted for strict vaccine export control measures, effectively slowing down access to medications for the Global South. Phrases like vaccine nationalism as well as vaccine passports have become commonplace. This twilight zone of deepening crises, and the imperial paranoid imaginary of what Neel Ahuja calls bioinsecurities, have long been represented by science fiction authors. Keeping a firm eye on epidemiology, race, and imperialism, this course charts a path along genre-bending, speculative fictions that imagine contagion and infection from the late-nineteenth to the early twenty-first century. Contagion emerges not just as a moral panic or embodied paranoia about infection, but as a method of relationality that draws tightly controlled, governmentalized worlds around raced and differentiated bodies. We will think about how these fictional netherworlds produce new subjectivities of life, death, and living death. Alongside science fictional as well as speculative novels, spanning postcolonial as well as US writing, we will also watch films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, District 9, Arrival, World War Z, and Contagion.",

    "ClassOverview": "Haunting the human imagination, the monstrous eludes precise definition, always standing for something else: something lurking beneath the surface, or just out of sight. How can a term signify the horrific and seemingly inhuman, yet simultaneously be reclaimed as a source of strength and solidarity by the outsider, shunned, and othered? In this course, we will investigate both ends of this equally captivating and complicated monstrous spectrum by reading a selection of short fictions by women that similarly elude genre categorization and delight in the inexplicable and the odd. From the mothers of the Gothic novel, Mary Shelley and Charlotte Dacre, to contemporary masters of unsettling short fictions like Octavia Butler and Carmen Maria Machado, we will trace how women writers have long turned to the supernatural, uncanny, and odd to respond to issues of gender, sexuality, race, class, and ability. In keeping with the length of these texts (primarily short stories and novellas), assignments and essays in this course will be exercises in brevity: how do we convey our ideas concisely and evocatively in a limited space? This work is achieved through drafting and revising, two activities we will do frequently over the course of the quarter as we reflect on how writing much like Mary Shelley's iconic monster is a messy, often unpredictable, but nonetheless powerful act of creation and communication.",

This course will explore representations of haunted houses in literature, film, and pop culture, examining why and how the space of daily life becomes an object to be feared. We will work together to understand the haunted house not only as an object of intrigue but an argumentative tool, a symbol through which authors and filmmakers direct our fears in particular ways. We will develop our own abilities to make arguments by critiquing the political and ideological agendas of literary haunted houses. We will ask, what techniques do authors use to render this intimate, familiar space strange and uncanny? What are we being asked to fear in stories of haunted houses? How do stories of haunted space reinforce or subvert dominant cultural fears of racial and gendered others, anxieties about the mixing of public and private life, or ideologies of the American family? We will also have the opportunity to reflect on our own home spaces, thinking about how negative feelings like confinement or boredom intersect with positive emotions like comfort, security, or pleasure to shape our experiences of being at home.",

How is our interpretation of a play shaped by Shakespeare's various texts his stories and their histories, the works of his contemporaries, the latest literary fashions, and the various versions of his plays that circulated among his audience?   Similarly, how do the details of a given performance, or the presence of a particular audience, alter the experience of the play? To answer these questions, we will consider not only the theaters of Early Modern England, but also recent cinematic versions of the plays, and we will read only our modern edition of Shakespeare but also examining some pages from the plays as they originally circulated. Our readings may include Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, Henry V, and the Tempest.",

    "ClassOverview": "Recent bestsellers such as The Girl on the Train and My Sister, the Serial Killer are part of a long legacy of wildly popular murder mysteries. In the early nineteenth century, murder, madness, and illicit sexuality were often confined to remote Gothic castles or the wilds of the English moors. With the rise of sensation fiction in Britain and detective stories in the United States, however, these middle-class nightmares invaded the supposedly blissful domestic scene. Writers also started to use murder as an occasion to pose radical questions about whose deaths were grievable. Beginning with bestselling authors Wilkie Collins and Edgar Allen Poe, this seminar follows the transatlantic tradition forward through Pauline Hopkins (author of the first Black murder mystery), mid-twentieth-century thrillers by Daphne du Maurier, and gritty detective fiction by Chester B. Himes. Paying particular attention to how gender and race shape the narration of these tales, the course will conclude with a survey of current chart-toppers by Paula Hawkins, Oyinkan Braithwaite, and others. Readings will be supplemented with films and prestige dramas, including the 2016 adaptation of The Girl on the Train and 2020's The Undoing.",

Along with reading poems that take up the subject, we will read several essays to undergird our discussion of the ethics of representation, positionality, and what it means to write about violence and trauma. In all of this, we will focus on the craft of writing poetry - metaphor, image, musicality, voice, etc. - with a focus on ekphrasis and intertextuality which will engage students in responding both to the works of art in the exhibition and the poems we will read in the course.",

We will brush up some of that previous knowledge, and build on that material and experience while continuing and deepening the apprenticeship to great writers, both contemporary and classic.  Students will read some examples of great taless both classic and contemporary, and will write several exercises and two stories during the quarter.In addition, good writers learn their craft through extensive critical reading.  Through close study, critique, and imitation of many different kinds of writers, you can push the boundaries of your own abilities and discover new ways to create fiction. Each week, I will assign two or three stories that focus on some advanced topics in writing, including What Makes a Tale Satisfying?, Using Objects in Fiction, Staying on the Surface, Villains, Using Jokes as a Way to Tell a Story, and Reading for Writers.",

    "ClassOverview": "In this course we will practice a cutting-edge form of nonfiction at the intersection of documentary, literature, experimental film and video art. We will apply literary techniques to the composition of short multimedia essays and explore the many ways in which writing with image and sound differs from writing for the page. Like its print counterpart, the video essay is an attempt to see what one thinks about something. The video essay may engage with fact, but tends to be less self-assured than documentary. Rather, the video essay, writes Phillip Lopate, wears confusion proudly as it gropes toward truth. Agnes Varda, the poetic French filmmaker who coined the term cin criture, or film writing, best described the promise of the form when noting that, for her, writing meant more than simply wording a script. Choosing images, designing sound these, too, were part of that process. At its best, the video essay leverages the visceral power of sound and image, builds a sympathetic resonance with language, and enlivens the senses. The goal of this course is to better understand how the act of writing is shaped and, in best cases, furthered, by visual and sonic elements. We will author our own short video essays and will, in the process, learn to record and edit video, produce layered soundscapes, and use our voices as tools of performance.",

    "ClassOverview": "Medieval culture was overwhelmingly Christian, but it was heir to several pre-Christian religions. Germanic paganism brought monsters, defiant heroism, and expectation of a coming twilight of the gods, while Celtic paganism supplied fairy temptresses, magical objects, and mysterious Otherworld visitors. Contrary to popular belief, the Church did not suppress the use of pagan sources in vernacular literature. But it's fascinating to see how medieval writers adapted and transformed the narrative materials they inherited, producing sophisticated texts that present an overtly Christian point of view layered above tantalizing and elusive pagan subtexts. We will read a selection of Old English, Middle English, and Old French works in translation, concentrating on Beowulf, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and legends of the Holy Grail. A crucial part of the class will be to look at modern adaptations of these works, including films ranging from the comic Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) to David Lowery's 2021 movie, The Green Knight.",

It began with the crowning of a king of Scotland over England, and by mid-century his son and heir had been tried under laws and executed for crimes against the people whom he described as his subjects.  It was a time that saw itself as revolutionary, which predictably in the seventeenth century meant two opposing things: a return to an imagined point of departure, and an overturning of values and expectations.  Revolutionary writing across England reflected and developed these dividing tendencies in every field: politics, science, and even in new forms of writing.  New voices and opinions emerged and were heard more widely than ever, those of women, working people, people on all sides of debates trying to reimagine what held them together as a community.  In this class we will read a variety of writers who tried to reimagine what would come of revolution and a world that seemed to have turned upside down.",

Before the homo/hetero divide, before what Michel Foucault calls as the implantation of the perverse, before genders in their modern forms, what were the routes, locations, effects, and politics of sex and desire? To what extent can we discuss sexuality in relation to identity in the pre-modern era? To address these complex questions, and to begin to ask new ones, we will concentrate on a range of exemplary literary and historical texts from around 1600 in England. We will be interested to explore both the multiple forms and functions of desire, eroticism, sex, asexuality, gender, gender-identification, etc. in this culture, as well as the terms, methods, and theories we now use to read the sexual past. We will gain fluency in the seemingly familiar but simultaneously foreign languages of early modern identities and desires: sodomy, tribadism, friendship, marriage; bodies, their parts, and their pleasures. We will interrogate sex/gender's intersections with such categories as race, religion, social class, and nation, and we will think through some new scholarship on trans* identities in early modern culture.",

    "ClassOverview": "The word Victorian exudes a certain stuffiness, a corseted and stiff-lipped repression characteristic of, and confined to, a distinct historical moment. Comparing modern sexual mores to those of the past, however, Michel Foucault notoriously deems us other Victorians in our erotic predilections and preoccupations, suggesting far less has changed since the nineteenth century than we might like to believe. By examining a number of nineteenth-century novels that particularly grapple with issues of desire, eroticism, and consent alongside queer and feminist scholarship, this course will investigate questions of sexual identity, desire, gender conformity, and fluidity, that remain provocative today. Melodramatic, sensational, sensual, and challenging, texts like Anne Bronte's Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White, and Olive Schreiner's Story of an African Farm give us the opportunity to reconsider what the Victorians referred to as the Woman Question: a growing social conservatism in response to changing gender conventions in no way confined to a single sex. How do these narratives negotiate questions of consent and kinship in response to growing calls during the period for gender equality? And what does the Victorian novel have to tell us we other Victorians about ways of thinking about sexual difference, deviance, and desire?",

    "ClassOverview": "Centered on the British Museum, the artists and intellectuals known as Bloomsbury formed, E. M. Forster claimed, the only genuine movement in English civilization. Prewar political and social movements had made some think that Europe might really be on the brink of becoming civilised (L. Woolf). The Great War (1914-1918) shattered millions of lives, marked the end of a civilization, disrupted a racialized imperialist and patriarchal social order, and challenged Europeans to rebuild their civilization on firmer ground (Freud). The ensuing contest between liberal democracy and rising totalitarianisms led to - and beyond - World War II. Bloomsbury's network includes Virginia and Leonard Woolf, co-founders of the Hogarth Press (which made Woolf the only woman in England free to write what I like); writers Forster, T. S. Eliot, Rupert Brooke, Katherine Mansfield, Lytton Strachey, Elizabeth Bowen, Radclyffe Hall, Vita Sackville-West (who inspired Orlando), David Garnett; painters Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant; art critics Roger Fry and Clive Bell; philosophers Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore; composer Ethel Smyth; economist John Maynard Keynes; founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud (a Hogarth author). These thinkers and artists grappled across disciplines with the challenges of a new century of rapid technological and social change.We'll study a selection of Virginia Woolf's major novels and essays alongside works by contemporaries and later writers in light of key contexts: the 1910 Post-Impressionist Exhibition; the women's movement and suffrage campaign; pacifism, world war, the Versailles peace conference; racialized British imperialism at home and abroad; the Spanish Civil War; Nazism, fascism, the early years of WWII. A visionary, influential modernist novelist and essayist, Woolf is also a theorist in the spirit of the Greek theoria: a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory; a sight, a spectacle (OED).  Her writings look at human beings--and human being to capture everyday private and public life amid spectacular changes in London, England, Europe, the British Empire, the greater world, and the known and imagined cosmos.",

At this moment, the notion of the Black woman writer may not seem anomalous or unusual. However, it was only a short time ago in history that to be a Black woman writer meant to be considered an aberration. Thomas Jefferson wrote that Phillis Wheatley's poems were beneath the dignity of criticism. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., suggested that Jefferson and a panel of white men held an official trial to interrogate the authenticity of Wheatley's work. These men would have never imagined that conference sessions, entire books, and countless critical articles would be dedicated to this foundational black woman writer: the very first black author to see their work published in the United States. We mark the beginning of Black published letters in the US with Wheatley; and it is within this tradition that we will consider the similarities and differences in content and forms by the women writers that we will read during this course.In this class, we will survey a wide range of Anglophone Black Diaspora women authors and primarily concentrate on the United States. Our authors will include Toni Morrison and Phillis Wheatley, as well as Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, Octavia Butler, and others.

Illness acts as narrative momentum, as a metaphor for social ills, and as a signifier of tragic virtue in an individual character. From the 19th century to the present, this class will examine how the tropes of illness in popular literature pertains to our broader cultural assumptions about illness and gender. How do traits associated with femininity resemble literary representations of illness, and vice-versa? How have these associations changed over time? How has the construction of ill femininity been bound up in whiteness, and how has this contributed to systemic and medical racism? What is the relationship between the representation of ill femininity and contemporary wellness culture? How might we locate or analyze femininity in representations of ill men?

    "ClassOverview": "When you write up a lab report, you probably don't approach it as a literary exercise.  Today we take science writing as an objective, transparent transcription of experimental data.  However, during the Scientific Revolution in Europe and Britain, literary form was vital to the transmission and popularization of new experimental methods.  Indeed, literary representation was necessary to help people conceive new sensory worlds at microscopic, sub-microscopic, or planetary scale.  In HUM 370/ ENG 385, we will explore the centrality of literary representation to pivotal new technologies in the early modern emergence of experimental science:  the microscope, the air-pump, the telescope, and the distillation apparatus.  These technologies did not only challenge fervently held convictions about the natural world endorsed by the Bible, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, among other authorities.  They also demanded new representational modes able to communicate concepts and vivify experiences inassimilable to old ways of understanding.  How can the pervasive agency of atmospheric pressure be figured in language?  What words make the magnified body of a flea familiar, even beautiful?  Why poeticize the chemical reactions involved in refining a new global commodity, sugar?  What political viewpoints accompany Copernican visions of possible planetary worlds?We will explore how literary technology was as integral to the New Science as experimental technology.  Throughout, we will approach western science not as universal knowledge but as highly situated practice, whose multifarious economic, extractive, and imperial investments are woven into the fabric of its literary representation.  We will dedicate significant time to satires of the new science, whose critical counter-representations of the frivolity, futility, or cruelty of experimental method illuminate the deep and ongoing stakes of science's relation to literature.The class will be broken into interconnected units organized around the air-pump, microscope, distillation apparatus, and telescope.  Literary genres will include descriptions of experiments (including those in a new venue, the scientific journal), treatises, illustrated books, engravings, poems, satires, and plays.  A list of texts by unit follows (some excerpted).  Air-pump:  Robert Boyle, experiments from New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air (1660) and Continuation (1669); Thomas Shadwell, The Virtuoso (1676); Daniel Defoe, A Journal of the Plague Year (1722); John Arbuthnot, Concerning the Effects of Air on Human Bodies (1733).  Microscope:  Robert Hooke, Micrographia (1665); Margaret Cavendish, Observations upon Experimental Philosophy (1668); Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels (1726).  Distillation Apparatus:  Robert Boyle, Origins of Forms and Qualities (1666); John Webster, Metallographia (1671); John Woodward, An Account of the Universal Deluge (1695) and Some Thoughts and Experiments concerning Vegetation (1699); John Phillips, Cyder. A Poem in Two Books (1708); Thomas Grainger, Sugar-Cane (1764).  Telescope:  Galileo Galilei, Starry Messenger (1610); Aphra Behn, A Discovery of New Worlds (1688); Eliza Haywood, Eovaai, Princess of Ijaveo (1736).  The telescope unit will conclude with one contemporary science fictional text, pending class consensus, which engages the contemporary stakes of envisioning new worlds (Ursula K.

How were relations across this fixed set of creaturely kinds understood, and how was the diversity of these life-forms explained?

Focusing on English Renaissance literature, this course will explore the teeming possibilities for thinking across species - before a starker the human/animal divide took shape. We'll map different approaches to natural history, ranging from re-readings of Genesis, to lawsuits filed against insects, to complaint poetry written in animal voices, to the night-rule of cats on the rooftops of London, to Shakespeare's animals (in their natural habitats of forest, field, and fantasy too), and then to the explicit pursuit of human empire over creatures with rise of seventeenth-century science.

She could not have imagined the extent to which Frankenstein would persist in popular culture. This class will consider the retellings, adaptations, appropriations, and parodies of Frankenstein. We will consider what aspects of Shelley's novel have survived in the popular imagination, and what we have changed. Why did the creature turn from a well-spoken, self-educated subject into a green, non-speaking monster? What lessons have we drawn from Dr. Frankenstein's ill-fated experiment? When and how have marginalized writers (re)claimed the creature as a figure of the oppressed? Why has Shelley's sentimental and atmospheric gothic novel inspired so much levity and humor? From the 1931 film adaptation to Susan Stryker's expression of trans rage in My Words to Victor Frankenstein (1994); from the beloved parody Young Frankenstein (1974) to Victor LaVelle's graphic novella series Destroyer (2017-), there seems to be no bottom to the relevance of Shelley's classic novel.

    "ClassOverview": "This selective-enrollment, yearlong Sequence is designed to make students increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry.  The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry including description, rhetoric, story and song and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and imitation assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of Daily Poems, thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others' work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course will allow you to explore how fiction works. We'll be looking at, discussing, writing about, commenting on, and researching the elements of fiction, but mostly what we'll be doing is writing buckets (you will be turning in a completed piece every other week during the Fall quarter), so we'll be reading mostly to steal: we'll figure out what works and we'll use it for our own material. We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you'll get.",

    "ClassOverview": "What is realism?  Do we even have to ask?  English 397 will investigate this seemingly obvious literary mode.  First, we will explore the conventional wisdom that realism emerges alongside the rise of modern science:  just as experiment becomes the standard of scientific truth, so early fiction bases its claim to be truth-like on its simulation of experimental testimony.  We'll read one exemplar of experimental witnessing, the travel narrative, in both true and fictional forms:  the privateer William Dampier's A New Voyage Around the World (1697) and Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719).  We will accompany these texts with short readings of scientific experiments (from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society and Robert Boyle's New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air) as well as some contemporary theories of the rise of the novel.  We will then read Olaudah Equiano's The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano (1789), which recounts its author's enslavement, displacement, manumission, and further voyages, to examine how Equiano redeploys the tropes of the travel narrative to argue for abolition.Turning to nineteenth-century realism and beyond, we will read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (1813) to consider its treatment of perceptual evidence, the founding premise of the realist mode.  How does Austen complicate or even reject sensory self-evidence as the basis for knowledge?  We will then read one classic of French realism, Honor de Balzac's Lost Illusions or P re Goriot (in English), alongside canonical critical takes on realism by Georg Luk cs, Fredric Jameson, and Roland Barthes.  In the course's penultimate unit, we will consider the status of the real in contemporary science studies.  We will examine the constructivist-realist debate in the history and sociology of science (readings by Thomas Kuhn, Ian Hacking, Steven Shapin, and Bruno Latour), whereby scientific truth may be a function of social convention.  We will be attuned to claims that it is the literary aspects of science that mask the constructedness of scientific truth claims we will be in a good position to examine.  We end the quarter with two contemporary novels that challenge the capacity of realist literary convention to capture marginalized realities:  Miriam Toews's Women Talking and Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad.  What, we will ask, is the literary and social currency of realism today?  Has realism internalized a capacity to reflect critically on the reality that it claims faithfully to represent?As a research seminar, this iteration of English 397 affords a range of prospective topics for a long research essay, extending from realism's founding texts through nineteenth-century realism, science studies, and contemporary feminist and antiracist appropriations of realism.  We will dedicate sustained class time to the tasks of articulating an essay topic, developing a bibliography, and structuring and drafting an argument.  To further these ends and promote collective understanding, some class sessions will be organized as workshops.",

As Vivian Gornick wrote, when the narrator becomes a persona, Its tone of voice, its angle of vision, the rhythm of its sentences, what it selects to observe and what to ignore are chosen to serve the subject; yet at the same time the way the narrator or the persona sees things is, to the largest degree, the thing being seen. In our discussion of the stories we tell, we will consider the use of ekphrasis, documentary evidence and other kinds of supplemental research.",

To what extent can we discuss sexuality in relation to identity in the pre-modern era? To address these complex questions, and to begin to ask new ones, we will concentrate on a range of exemplary literary and historical texts from around 1600 in England. We will be interested to explore both the multiple forms and functions of desire, eroticism, sex, gender, etc., in this culture, as well as the terms, methods, and theories we now use to read the sexual past. We will be particularly interested in gaining fluency in the languages of early modern identities and desires: sodomy, tribadism, friendship, marriage; bodies, their parts, and their pleasures. We will centrally engage recent critical controversies in the field over the utility of historicism in sexuality studies. We will interrogate sex/gender's intersections with categories such as race, religion, social class, and nation, and we will engage the emerging scholarship in early modern trans* studies.",

While readings and discussions will gravitate toward contemporary Marxist and post-Marxist ecological thought (including the afterlives of ideas like primitive accumulation and metabolic rift in recent feminist, anti-colonial, and environmental frameworks), we will also spend time looking at the writings and influence of earlier thinkers whose controversial materialisms have returned to critical attention in recent decades (e.g. Lucretius, Spinoza, Herder). A guiding aim of the course is to assemble a fuller sense of the historical and conceptual underpinnings of first-world environmentalism; so we will ask what matters, and to whom, in part by putting greenness under scrutiny as a critical category.

    "ClassOverview": "This course takes its point of departure from a careful reading of The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt's massive study of Nazi totalitarianism and its origins in anti-Semitism and European imperialism.  For the first three weeks of the class, we will read the three sections of the Origins along with a selection of Arendt's contemporaneous writings on issues at the heart of her study: wide-scale statelessness and forced migration; racism and imperial expansion; totalitarian propaganda and the holes of oblivion.  Arendt recognized that the Origins posed a question that remained unanswered in that work:  faced with the manufacture of living corpses, what preserves our humanity and redeems our actions?  Arendt's next major work, The Human Condition, thus moves toward an analysis of the conditions and modes of human activity:  from the biological life process, to the world-creating capacity of homo faber, to the urgency and fragility of human action.  As we read The Human Condition, which seeks to answer the question posed by the Origins by accounting for what European philosophy has generally failed to analyze with sufficient clarity namely, the dimensions of the active life we examine Arendt's attempt in the same period to review and, in her own way, deconstruct the concepts of thinking around which the ideal of a contemplative life concretized.  This prepares us for a reading in the final weeks of the seminar of Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she re-conceptualizes evil as a certain implementation of systematic thoughtlessness.   As we examine these three major works, each of which is a reflection on the relation between language and politics, we will continually attend to the varying ways in which Arendt sought to understand where poetry stands in relation to human conditionality, and we will use her often-neglected suggestions in this regard to develop an Arendtian poetics.",

The class will cover these effects, their impact on Native American and non-Native communities, the maple syrup industry, and maple species themselves through articles and readings. We will also cover other aspects of Native American food sovereignty happening across the United States and Canada. Students will work in groups, to collect data from three maple species on campus and examine sugar ratios, sap flow rates, and ambient temperature and precipitation: along with a focus on species differentiation, soil nutrients, and campus micro-climates. The final product for the class would be a group data report. A copy of the report will go to facilities management to be added to their campus tree inventory.",

    "ClassOverview": "Despite decades of climate science research, current climate action remains limited in its ability to effectively mitigate the impacts of climate change. Efforts to reduce emissions are well-intentioned attempts to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, but have yet to spur the magnitude of action required. In this course we will explore the intersections of climate science, traditional ecological knowledge, and climate justice to unpack how different knowledge systems inform and impact effective climate governance and policy. Often unrecognized in science and policy arenas, traditional ecological knowledge generates insights for strengthening efforts to effectively address climate change. In this course, we ask: to what extent and how do different knowledge systems gain and lose traction in different climate policy arenas? How, why, and with what effects are the science and policy of climate change far removed from the people most vulnerable to its impacts? Is the exclusivity of science marginalization of knowledge systems and extricating climate science from climate change experiences the greatest threat to effective climate action? And, how might policy arenas facilitate the introduction, deliberation, and circulation of plural worldviews and knowledge systems?In this research seminar, students will directly engage with an ongoing collaborative research project that seeks to answer these questions. The seminar is structured to reflect the research process. Students enrolled in this course should consider themselves research apprentices and collaborators. There are three parts to this course: literature review, data analysis, and execution. In the first part of the course, we begin by first identifying and engaging with the empirical puzzles around science and knowledge in global climate governance to formulate a series of questions that emerge from these puzzles. We will engage the literature on global climate governance, climate policy, and knowledge politics, explore different research methods and approaches, including ethnography, content and discourse analysis, and quantitative interpretation of qualitative data. Each student will then conduct a mini-literature review on one of our broader questions and propose a research question, hypothesis (argument), and methodological strategy for carrying out the research. In the second part of the course, we will work to develop data collection and analysis skills. In the third part of the course, we complete the execution of the project, with each student developing and strengthening analytical writing skills by producing an original research paper.",

    "ClassOverview": "Climate change is the keystone environmental issue of this generation, and most likely for many generations to come. While the world community and individual countries have formulated policies to address climate change, these policies are almost universally recognized as being wholly inadequate to effectuate the objective of the Paris Agreement to hold global temperatures to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit increases to 1.5C. This has led to increasing calls for research and development, and potential deployment, of so-called climate geoengineering options, defined as deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's natural systems to counteract climate change. This includes solar radiation management (SRM) approaches that seek to cool the Earth by deflecting income solar radiation back to space by approaches such as dispersing sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere and brightening clouds, as well as carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches that seek to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it, or utilize it for production of products or energy. These options include nature-based solutions, e.g. tree planting or enhancing soil uptake of carbon, direct air capture through the use of filtration systems, and ocean-based approaches.This course will assess to examine the case for climate geoengineering as a third component to address climate change, alongside mitigation and adaptation, as well as a granular assessment of the potential effectiveness and risks of the most widely discussed approaches. We will also discuss aspects of governance and public engagement in decision making. Moreover, I will also seek to help students develop critical skills of analysis, public speaking, and writing.",

In the same way that our political and social discourses on circulation and migration shift according to changing political social and historical conditions, so do their literary inscriptions. In this course, we turn to these ever-present motifs in Francophone African literary writings and cinema. We clearly cannot exhaustively explore all the rich possibilities of this theme, given the time limit of a quarter. However, the works chosen will expose students to both a broad historical and political framework and geographical expanse. We will begin with migration and movement in the colonial era and move forward in time. We will also travel from West Africa to North Africa and the Indian Ocean in order to explore the modalities of movement and circulation in their political, historical, and geographical contexts. The literary and cinematic corpus of the class is robustly supported with theoretical and historical materials and lectures. Movement also hints at the affective and emotional charge of circulation, be it understood as migration forced of voluntary return, or simply as travel. The modalities of affects linked to movement will constitute an important dimension of our analyses.",

    "ClassOverview": "In recent years, increasing attention is being directed to deciphering the everyday with the understanding that monuments, public spaces and everyday objects and practices as well as cultural objects and practices are bearers of layers of meaning. The idea is not new. Twentieth century French thought has produced robust and sustained reflections on how to understand and relate to the everyday as a cultural and ideological field. Yet, much of these thoughts are set aside and forgotten, naturalizing our relationship to what is actually produced and constructed in such a way as to do specific ideological work. This course will return to this practice of reading and deciphering our everyday myths.The course is organized around Mythologies postcoloniales (2018) which has recently received a great deal of attention given the urgency of the debates about legacies of colonialism and racism in the public space both in the United States and around the world. In this book, Etienne Achille and Lydie Moudelino reflect on names and legacies of public spaces in France, such as streets, through the lens of colonial history and historiographical and interpretative methods informed by Roland Barthes' famous Mythologies (1957). We will therefore begin by reading segments of Mythologies in order to understand both the ways in which the notion of mythology is defined by Roland Barthes and his distinct method of reading cultural and everyday objects and practices, uncovering their ideological substrata. We will then read Mythologies postcoloniales to understand its particular angle in mobilizing this method to critique the legacies of colonial history and its relationship to memory.We will conclude this first phase of the course by reading a critique of Barthes's discourse by Lydie Modelino with understanding that mythologizing and ideological discourses cannot necessarily be excluded from politically, culturally and intellectually thoughtful critical projects. This will allow us to then take account of our practices and become critical analysts of how we read the world. Students will practice their own acts of reading and deciphering in order to put their theoretical knowledge to work and to decipher the world in which they circulate, for we often can see the ideological underpinning of others' activities than our own.In phase two of the course covering the last three weeks of the quarter, students will develop, research, and write a culminating research project beginning with the framework provided by our class readings and then expanding and deepening it by selecting their own topic for research and actually doing the work of research and investigation.",

    "ClassOverview": "Godard says of the cinema that it was essentially a nineteenth-century matter that was resolved in the twentieth century. For the cinema, the emblematic medium of the twentieth century, turned the powers specific to it (e.g., montage, projection photography) to articulating or developing aesthetic, philosophical and political problems posed by literature, philosophy and painting in the previous century. This invites us to think the relationship between centuries in two ways. First, problems posed in the 19th-century continue to shape (and limit the possibilities of) the forms in which twentieth-century art mobilizes its powers. For, having outlived the situation in which they were initially formulated, these problems continue (in Marx's phrase) to weigh like a nightmare on the brains of the living. Second, it becomes necessary for those who find themselves within this history to conduct an archaeology of nineteenth-century art and thought as a prehistory of twentieth-century culture. This course will explore these questions by reading canonical literary texts of the 19th century (by authors such as Balzac, Michelet, Flaubert, Baudelaire and Zola) alongside cinematic works (such as those of Bu1uel, Renoir, Marker, Walsh and Godard), as well as critical texts (such as Benjamin, Jameson, Kracauer, Deleuze and Ranci re).",

In the revised article, students develop an original argument relative to a significant problem or research question; demonstrate knowledge of relevant primary and secondary sources and the ability to evaluate them critically; engage with an appropriate theoretical or scholarly methodology; and draw out clearly the significance of their findings. The class meets regularly as a group for the purpose of discussion and feedback on individual work. Students submit written assignments and make short presentations on essential elements of their articles, including the argument, the current state of the secondary research, and their contribution to the field. In addition, they receive and write a reader's report similar to those generated by referees of journal submissions. Throughout the course, students will meet individually with the professor to discuss their progress in addition to working with their peers. Work written or revised over the course of the quarter will be shared and discussed in the final class meeting. This course is required for 2nd and 3rd year graduate students in French.

    "ClassOverview": "The human body is embedded into a health framework that can produce hypervisibility, invisibility, or both. This upper-level course in social science and medical anthropology examines the role of social markers of difference, including race, class, gender, sexuality, age, and religion, in current debates and challenges in the theory and practice of global health. We will explore recent illness experiences, therapeutic and self-care interventions, and health practices and behaviors in socio-cultural and historical context through case studies in the U.S., Brazil, and South Africa. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to key concepts such as embodiment, medicalization, structural violence, social determinants of health, biopolitics, health equity, and an ethic of care. Central questions of the course include: How do categories of Othering determine disease and health in individuals and collectives? How is medical science and care influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient trust? How do social and economic inclusion/exclusion control access to health treatment and self-care and care of others? This course focuses on the linkages between society and health inequalities in the U.S. and economic powers. It offers a forum to explore policy application with a particular emphasis on definitions that form social factors. This course utilizes historical accounts, contemporary ethnographies, Twitter threads of health experiences, public health literature, media reports, TedTalks, and films to bring to life the why's of health differences.",

You may have seen them in pornography, but have you ever wanted to study and talk about sex, and specifically, how to have a satisfying sex life? Many people look to pornography not just for entertainment, but also for education about what satisfying sexual encounters look like. Unfortunately, much of what people learn from pornography doesn't lead them to healthy and satisfying sexual encounters and relationships. This lecture class seeks to go beyond many presumptions about sex and pleasure from pornography and popular culture, in order to equip students with information that can lead to more satisfying and healthy sexual experiences. Topics covered will include: physiological and biological sex; gender; sexual orientation; sexual variety; sexual pleasure; sexual dysfunctions; intimacy and effective communication; sexually transmitted infections; contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth; sexuality through the lifespan; sexual violence and coercion; as well as content driven specifically by students' specific interests and questions as relates to sexuality, health and pleasure. The course also takes a cross-cultural and historical perspective, exploring how past and present perceptions about sex and gender affect prominent attitudes and presumptions about human sexuality and health in different contexts.",

We will focus on the legal foundations of the trust responsibility and fiduciary obligation of the federal government outlined in the U.S. Constitution and Supreme Court decisions.

    "ClassOverview": "To be healthy is a complex obstacle course that many individuals living in certain bodies have to navigate. Black bodies, for example, are often the tied to (un)health because they are stereotyped as in need to be controlled, managed, and guided into healthfulness. In the U.S., these narrow stereotypes are just a few of the ways Black bodies get defined. In this course, we will move beyond those restrictive stereotypes, guided by questions such as, How does culture define health?, How does the food pipeline affect the health of certain bodies? and What does it mean to live in an obesogenic environment? In this course, we examine the connection between health, culture, food, and environment with a focus on what is silenced and what is loud when generating fixes for diseased bodies. Silence refers to the disregard and dismissiveness of the narratives and experiences around the oppressions attached to the health of certain bodies. Yet, this silence echoes as Loud when connected to their culture, food, and environment when discussing diseases highlighted in Black bodies such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.",

The first two weeks cover the meteorology necessary for understanding the local and global systems of atmospheric circulation. This leads to the Koppen climate model which predicts the location of climate types. With climate as a basis, we then turn to the study of soils and vegetation. Soils are strongly influenced by climate and parent material and they vary in their ability to store water and nutrients. Processes of plant growth and decay respond directly to climate and soil productivity which leads to biomass production. All of the biogeographic processes are then used to derive expected patterns of natural vegetation around the world. Local-scale variations are brought in as modifications of the global model. Discrepancies between the predicted and what is actually found in a particular place generally reflect the role of human impacts. Tropical forests, savannas, deserts, grasslands, temperate broadleaf forests, needleleaf boreal forests, and tundra are all interpretable in terms of the physical processes developed in this course.",

The region refers variously to the Midwest, the state of Illinois, Chicagoland, or just to Chicago and its suburbs. Introductory materials include the kinds of data that have been used to study and describe Chicago. Following that comes the necessary background on the changing physical environment of Chicago since the Pleistocene, including the step-by-step evolution of Lake Michigan. Human groups are traced from prehistory through the Native tribes that inhabited the region at the time of European contact. We will follow the record of land treaties, whereby the Native inhabitants lost their lands, which was followed by land subdivision and land grants made by the U.S. government around 1800.   Chicago grows into a major industrial center during the 19th century which sees a series of shifts in population composition due to migration. The first part of the course ends with the Burnham Plan, which marks a turning point in Chicago history as a major city. The second part of the course traces the themes of 20th century Chicago geography, especially the role of the African American population and the continued arrival of new immigrant groups from Latin America and Asia. Contemporary problems, including racism, suburbanization, depopulation, and changing demographic and economic patterns are the final topics.",

And subsequent shifts in German public discourse and state policy have indicated the extent to which historical conversations about immigration and identity continue to impact the contemporary moment. In this course, we will address the crisis as treated in the German-speaking world with an eye to its representation in the media and culture, the manifold political responses, and historical debates on migration, citizenship, and diversity. Students will follow ongoing news stories, familiarize themselves with current and historical policies regarding asylum in German-speaking countries, and read, watch, and discuss depictions of migrants, refugees, and guests in German-language literature and film. In addition, students will be asked to compare their findings with the situation in the US in the past and present to gain a deeper understanding of the issues involved and developed a nuanced understanding of both societies.",

    "ClassOverview": "The seminar seeks to encompass two major moments in the field of aesthetics:  during the first five weeks we examine the founding of science of aesthetics in Alexander Baumgarten's doctoral dissertation (1735) and its putative completion in Hegel's posthumously published lectures (1835);  in the following five weeks, we turn to the attempts on the part of Walter Benjamin and Martin Heidegger around 1935 to dispose with the founding conception of aesthetics and correspondingly approach the work of art in very different but also perhaps complementary or entangled ways.  The four primary texts for the seminar are Baumgarten's Mediationes philosophicae de nonnullius ad poema pertinentibus (Philosophical meditations on something more than nothing pertaining to the poem), the introduction to Hegel's Vorlesungen cber  sthetik (Lectures on aesthetics), Heidegger's Ursprung des Kunstwerks (Origin of the artwork), and Benjamin's Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter des technischen Reproduzierbarkeit (The artwork in the age of its technical reproducibility).  Other ancillary and secondary works will be also be considered, depending on student interest and the direction of the conversation.  We will work closely with the Latin and German texts; but the seminar will be conducted in English, and no knowledge of either German or Latin is required.",

Sometimes cyberspace is depicted as a continuation of previous media such as television, cinema or telephone, but often it is envisioned as a new frontier. This course will examine the ways in which virtual media appears in cultural discourses. We consider how technological objects and tools participate in shaping elements of our culture that may appear natural, logical, or timeless. Our guiding questions will include the following: In what ways are these narratives shaping collective perceptions of the internet? How have virtual technologies challenged experiences of language, gender, community and identity? We will focus on social networking, gaming, artificial intelligence, and literary and filmic representations of these. Following a Cultural Studies model for inquiry, this course will be project-based and experiential. Your attendance and participation are mandatory. No experience needed, only a willingness to take risks and share work. There will be writing assignments in multiple formats.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Pleasure in the Archives. Our seminar, co-taught by NU archivist Jason Nargis, will be held in Special Collections and a portion of each class will be devoted to working with archival materials. Course readings will include selections from recent dissident histories of 1970s feminism. Together we will examine selections from these histories with an eye towards how they make use of new archives, reading strategies and research methods to offer a more nuanced account of second-wave feminism and practice using these research strategies through in-class assignments with (pre-selected) archival materials. As historian Finn Enke points out 1970s feminism has entered collective memory as an exclusionary thing, distinct from the experiences, labor, and critiques by feminists of color, trans and queer people of the same era but challenges us to reconsider feminism's deeply questioning, queer, coalitional and anti-imperialist past, or risk missing some ways that feminist, lesbian, and queer of color and trans activists grappled hard to develop critical insights and knowledges that move us today. Much recent scholarship on this period has taken up Enke's challenge including histories that document the anti-imperialist and coalitional politics of the gay and lesbian left (Lavender and Red, 2016), explore the long history of transfeminist activism (TSQ Special Issue: Trans/Feminisms, 2016), recuperate the critical contributions of Black feminist organizations in broadening the scope of the women's movement (Living for the Revolution: Black Feminist Organizations, 1968-1980, 2005), and chronicle activism by, for, and about incarcerated domestic violence survivors, criminalized rape resisters, and dissident women prisoners in 1970s and early 1980s (All Our Trials: Prisons, Policing and the Feminist Fight to End Violence, 2018). Our goal in this seminar is to engage and contribute to this larger project through our own collective archival research. Our final class project will be to collectively curate our findings in two forms an exhibition in the Main Library and as a StoryMap (https://storymap.knightlab.com/). This seminar will introduce students to the practice of archival research as well as to the remarkable range of archival materials from this period housed in Special Collections at NU and will also include two lab sessions in the Media and Design Studio.",

We argue towards a theory of Black feminist health science studies that builds on social justice science, which has as its focus the health and well-being of marginalized groups. Students will engage feminist science theories that range from explorations of the linguistic metaphors of the immune system, the medicalization of race, to critiques of the sexual binary.

You may have seen them in pornography, but have you ever wanted to study and talk about sex, and specifically, how to have a satisfying sex life? Many people look to pornography not just for entertainment, but also for education about what satisfying sexual encounters look like. Unfortunately, much of what people learn from pornography doesn't lead them to healthy and satisfying sexual encounters and relationships. This lecture class seeks to go beyond many presumptions about sex and pleasure from pornography and popular culture, in order to equip students with information that can lead to more satisfying and healthy sexual experiences. Topics covered will include: physiological and biological sex; gender; sexual orientation; sexual variety; sexual pleasure; sexual dysfunctions; intimacy and effective communication; sexually transmitted infections; contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth; sexuality through the lifespan; sexual violence and coercion; as well as content driven specifically by students' specific interests and questions as relates to sexuality, health and pleasure. The course also takes a cross-cultural and historical perspective, exploring how past and present perceptions about sex and gender affect prominent attitudes and presumptions about human sexuality and health in different contexts.",

We will read the work of authors like Xiao Hong, Zhang Ailing, Ding Ling, Wang Anyi, Can Xue, Guo Xiaoluo, Hong Ying, among others, and, drawing from a variety of disciplinary approaches, we will explore the fraught relationship between gender, sexuality, literature, and identity.We will first engage the rise of female professional authors between the fall of the Qing and the Republican period, to then turn to the political turn in authors during the rise of the CCP; lastly, we will move on to late twentieth and early twenty-first century female-authored fiction in the Sinophone and beyond. In addition to primary sources, we will integrate theoretical work in the field of gender and sexuality studies, feminist studies, and queer theory, as well as Chinese cinema and culture. Previous knowledge of Chinese literature and culture, though helpful, is not required. We will spend a great deal of time reading primary sources (in English translation, and in Chinese, for those who are able to), so the only real requisite for this is to love reading fiction.",

Before the homo/hetero divide, before what Michel Foucault calls as the implantation of the perverse, before genders in their modern forms, what were the routes, locations, effects, and politics of sex and desire? To what extent can we discuss sexuality in relation to identity in the pre-modern era? To address these complex questions, and to begin to ask new ones, we will concentrate on a range of exemplary literary and historical texts from around 1600 in England. We will be interested to explore both the multiple forms and functions of desire, eroticism, sex, asexuality, gender, gender-identification, etc. in this culture, as well as the terms, methods, and theories we now use to read the sexual past. We will gain fluency in the seemingly familiar but simultaneously foreign languages of early modern identities and desires: sodomy, tribadism, friendship, marriage; bodies, their parts, and their pleasures. We will interrogate sex/gender's intersections with such categories as race, religion, social class, and nation, and we will think through some new scholarship on trans* identities in early modern culture.",

Reading within historical studies of criminality in the social sciences, specifically anthropology and political science, we will consider queer criminality as a departure from other interpretations of crime as - for instance - pathological, symptomatic, opportunistic, reactionary, constructed, or in collusion with legitimate political and economic orders. While still attending to these themes through keys texts in the study of crime, this course reflects on how conceptualizations of political transgression and crime have been historically transformed and renewed through queer thought and approaches, particularly through figures such as the deviant, the outlaw, or the rebel. We will discuss these figures within theorizations of broader political transgression, such as social movements, uprisings, and revolutions.",

Before the homo/hetero divide, before what Michel Foucault calls as the implantation of the perverse, before genders in their modern forms, what were the routes, locations, effects, and politics of sex and desire? To what extent can we discuss sexuality in relation to identity in the pre-modern era? To address these complex questions, and to begin to ask new ones, we will concentrate on a range of exemplary literary and historical texts from around 1600 in England. We will be interested to explore both the multiple forms and functions of desire, eroticism, sex, asexuality, gender, gender-identification, etc. in this culture, as well as the terms, methods, and theories we now use to read the sexual past. We will gain fluency in the seemingly familiar but simultaneously foreign languages of early modern identities and desires: sodomy, tribadism, friendship, marriage; bodies, their parts, and their pleasures. We will interrogate sex/gender's intersections with such categories as race, religion, social class, and nation, and we will think through some new scholarship on trans* identities in early modern culture.",

Illness acts as narrative momentum, as a metaphor for social ills, and as a signifier of tragic virtue in an individual character. From the 19th century to the present, this class will examine how the tropes of illness in popular literature pertains to our broader cultural assumptions about illness and gender. How do traits associated with femininity resemble literary representations of illness, and vice-versa? How have these associations changed over time? How has the construction of ill femininity been bound up in whiteness, and how has this contributed to systemic and medical racism? What is the relationship between the representation of ill femininity and contemporary wellness culture? How might we locate or analyze femininity in representations of ill men? What about mental illness? Our readings will be split between popular representations of illness in novels and writings by ill authors, and we will consider how literary tropes are or are not reappropriated by the latter. -- Readings Include: Anonymous, The Woman of Colour (1808); Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice (1813); Katherine Anne Porter, Pale Horse, Pale Rider (1939); Octavia Butler, Parable of the Sower (1993); David Chariandy, Soucouyant (2007).

This course will examine the ways in which virtual media appears in cultural discourses.

If, as Arundhati Roy has written, the pandemic is a portal between one world and the next, what do we carry with us to fight for the world to come? This class examines the classic works of feminist theory and their political interventions in light of our solidarity with the social justice vision of #BlackLivesMatter, a movement named and launched by Black women.  We will reconsider foundational questions of feminist theorizing: 1. How has intersectionality challenged who and what is a woman?  2. Who makes knowledge and for whom? 3. Futurism and utopias.  4. In creating a queer affirming, trans uplifting community, welcoming to all gender expressions and all sexual identities, regardless of economic status, age, ability or disability, religious beliefs or disbeliefs, immigration status, or location, #BLM philosophy affirms that protest is expansive and loving.  Importantly, what do we learn from restorative justice as a healing practice in the struggles against anti-Black state-sanctioned and vigilante violence?  How do we re-center feminisms within the long genealogy of freedom, abolitionism(s), and world-making?",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Medieval WomenWhat did medieval women think about? What were their hopes and dreams? How close did they come to realizing their dreams and what forces stood in their way? This course will attempt to answer these questions by examining the writings by and about women from different classes, who live in different centuries, and write (or were written about) in different genres. Each of our protagonists will be placed in their proper historical contexts so they can be understood on their own terms. Learn how the high-spirited Heloise had an extra-marital liaison with one of the most controversial intellectuals of Western Europe; how the unflappable Christina of Markyate defied parents and husband to live as an anchoress;  how the writer Marie de France was the true forbear of Harlequin romances; how the aristocratic Christine de Pizan defended all women from male slander; and how Margery Kempe, a mystic wanna-be, got rid of her husband and married God.",

This will not be a technical history of the computer science or actual infrastructure that constitute the internet, but rather a history of the social and political ideas contributing to a worldwide system of networked computers and protocols. In particular, the course will discuss the culture surrounding the internet - the ways that the Cold War, the counterculture, libertarianism, and environmentalism all fostered a set of beliefs that helped define Silicon Valley and continue to shape companies that call for revolution one day and place their trust in the market the next.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Climate and Weather in HistoryFrom the changing seasons, to frigid ice ages, to violent cyclones, to global warming, the phenomena of weather and climate have been crucial sites of interaction between humans and our environments. In this first-year seminar, we will ask: how have climatic changes across space and time shaped human societies, politics, and histories? And how have our ways of explaining and predicting the weather reflected changing approaches to nature's uncertainties? Moving from antiquity to the present, we will study the evolution of meteorological science from the study of meteors' to variable weather,' alongside the conceptual shift from a globe of many climates' to a singular, global climate.' Using a range of case studies from the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia, and sources including almanacs and weather proverbs, we will explore how in different ways across geographies and cultures, climate functioned both as a force of history and as an object of scientific fascination. By the end of the course, students will be able to situate the current climate crisis in an age many scholars call the Anthropocene within a centuries-long history of adaptations and negotiations with our planet's atmosphere, and with one another.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Jerusalem: History and Politics from 1517 to 2021'What is Jerusalem to you?' Asked Bailian to Saladin while surrendering the city in 1187. 'Nothing. Everything', replied Saladin. (Cit. Kingdom of Heaven - a movie with Orlando Bloom - not to be taken literally, in case you have not watched it).In this freshman seminar students will gain basic knowledge of Jerusalem's past, its religious meanings in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and its role in the modern conflict in the Middle East. Jerusalem is one the most ancient and contested cities in the world, and covering the long history of this city would be both wearing and unrevealing, therefore this course aims to provide students with the tools to tackle the question: how does one study something like Jerusalem?As we are dealing with a city with a complex history and politics, different meanings for a variety of religious traditions and with different connotations in the respective historical memory of the various national and religious communities, we will study Jerusalem drawing on a number of theories and disciplines. We will engage with traditional historical writings, but we will also rely on art history, political theory, anthropology, ethnography, and media studies. We will also look at representation of Jerusalem around the world, from the replica of Churches and holy places to Biblical theme parks.Chronologically, we will cover from 1517, when Ottoman forces took the city from the Mamluks, up until 2021. As the Ottomans ruled the city for four centuries, we will look at trends including demography, economics, modernization and cosmopolitanism. The study of the British Mandatory era and of Jerusalem divided between Israel and Jordan, will allow us to look at how the city play into the formation and dissemination of Zionist and Palestinian national narratives. Lastly, a brief survey of the contemporary era will allow us to understand the current politics of the city and the challenges ahead.While it is true that Jerusalem is at the center of the current Arab-Israeli-Palestinian conflict, nevertheless, during this course we will strive to remind ourselves that Jerusalem is a city, populated by individuals who inhabit and interact with that space on a daily basis.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Period Pieces: US History as Told by Popular CultureHistory has been a rich source of inspiration for generations of artists - but all great creators take at least a few artistic liberties when adapting stories about the past for the present day. To the frustration of historians everywhere, these fictional representations often supersede true events in public memory; no witches were burned in Salem, Massachusetts and a young George Washington did not chop down a cherry tree, but these fictions have become truer than the facts. This course explores U.S. history by screening fictional films set in the American past and studying the true events that inspired these same films.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Hamilton's AmericaLin-Manuel Miranda's musical, Hamilton, has become a national sensation, capturing the imaginations of Americans young and old, far and wide, of diverse backgrounds and ancestries. A hip hop infused musical, Hamilton is widely considered to have revolutionized the genre of the Broadway musical, just as many saw the American Revolution as a first for the world. There is also a resurgence of interest in Hamilton and Lin-Manuel Miranda, because of the Hamilton movie, put out by Disney+ a year ago, Miranda's recent production of his first musical, In the Heights; and the reopening of Hamilton on Broadway. We'll discuss of these things, in addition to Hamilton's evolving meaning and reception in 2015, when the musical first appeared, and 2021, a very different political and cultural moment in U.S. history. Students in this course will learn, first, about Hamilton's life and times. Easily among the most polarizing figures of a famously polarized generation, Hamilton was a Caribbean-born British subject who became an American revolutionary, a bastard brat who became Treasury Secretary, a man who helped to lead thirteen of Britain's American colonies in a violent independence war only to advocate a financial plan and a foreign policy that presented Britain as a role model. In studying his life and politics, we will also explore early American notions of honor and masculinity, marriage and infidelity, freedom and slavery. As we study Hamilton the man, we will also study Hamilton the musical, attempting to account for its extraordinary contemporary resonance. Why has this past person's continued to inspire such interest today, in a nation that looks so different from the one that Hamilton (and his enemies) knew? Where does the musical diverge from the history, and what does that say about our memory and use of the past? Does the musical offer an inspiring, multiethnic vision of U.S. history or, as some have argued, a more haunting and problematic one? When audiences leave the theater, what do they take away about early America and America today and about themselves?",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Hamilton's AmericaLin-Manuel Miranda's musical, Hamilton, has become a national sensation, capturing the imaginations of Americans young and old, far and wide, of diverse backgrounds and ancestries. A hip hop infused musical, Hamilton is widely considered to have revolutionized the genre of the Broadway musical, just as many saw the American Revolution as a first for the world. There is also a resurgence of interest in Hamilton and Lin-Manuel Miranda, because of the Hamilton movie, put out by Disney+ a year ago, Miranda's recent production of his first musical, In the Heights; and the reopening of Hamilton on Broadway. We'll discuss of these things, in addition to Hamilton's evolving meaning and reception in 2015, when the musical first appeared, and 2021, a very different political and cultural moment in U.S. history. Students in this course will learn, first, about Hamilton's life and times. Easily among the most polarizing figures of a famously polarized generation, Hamilton was a Caribbean-born British subject who became an American revolutionary, a bastard brat who became Treasury Secretary, a man who helped to lead thirteen of Britain's American colonies in a violent independence war only to advocate a financial plan and a foreign policy that presented Britain as a role model. In studying his life and politics, we will also explore early American notions of honor and masculinity, marriage and infidelity, freedom and slavery. As we study Hamilton the man, we will also study Hamilton the musical, attempting to account for its extraordinary contemporary resonance. Why has this past person's continued to inspire such interest today, in a nation that looks so different from the one that Hamilton (and his enemies) knew? Where does the musical diverge from the history, and what does that say about our memory and use of the past? Does the musical offer an inspiring, multiethnic vision of U.S. history or, as some have argued, a more haunting and problematic one? When audiences leave the theater, what do they take away about early America and America today and about themselves?",

We will also try to think about what the future might find significant about our own time.Students will learn historical thinking skills, critical reading, and historical argumentation, and will complete a final project providing historical context for a contemporary of their choice.",

Religions are implicated in every aspect of American civilization. In the languages and practices of religious traditions, old and new, inherited and invented, and in the company of their gods, Americans dealt with war (hot and cold), economic trauma, and cultural changes. We will examine instances of public religious expression, religious motivations for political decisions, and the complexity of religious tolerance as a foundation in American life.As this courses asks about the role of religion in American life, topics include Cold War religious identities; the Civil Rights Movement; Vatican II Catholicism; religious immigration, women and gender in religious thought and practice; evangelical Christianity in politics and media; Islamophobia; interfaith initiatives; and contemporary religious demographics. The time period we will cover is well within contemporary memory, so we will be probing the religious makings of our own world, as we encounter its past.

We will examine instances of public religious expression, religious motivations for political decisions, and the complexity of religious tolerance as a foundation in American life.As this courses asks about the role of religion in American life, topics include Cold War religious identities; the Civil Rights Movement; Vatican II Catholicism; religious immigration, women and gender in religious thought and practice; evangelical Christianity in politics and media; Islamophobia; interfaith initiatives; and contemporary religious demographics. The time period we will cover is well within contemporary memory, so we will be probing the religious makings of our own world, as we encounter its past. How did we get to where we are today in American religious life and understanding? What do we learn about ourselves through the lens of religious history?",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Arabs and Jews in Palestine/Land of IsraelThis course will explore the historical relations between Jews and Arabs in Palestine/The Land of Israel from the close of the nineteenth century to 1948. According to prevalent assumption, both inside and outside academia, the relationship between Jews and Arabs in those years was solely characterized by mutual rivalry, violence, and conflict. This course, however, aims to challenge this approach by looking at diverse interactions that went beyond the political rivalry between the two communities. Relying on a 'History from Below' approach, we will analyse shared identities and joint experiences, and discuss a wide range of daily encounters and collaborations which took place between ordinary Jews and Arabs in different spheres such as: mixed cities, education system, business and labor market, political organizations, leisure spaces and more. Using historical primary sources, we will examine the myriad ways in which Jews and Arabs formed personal and even romantic relationships in the background of the escalating national struggle.",

These centuries changed the course of European and world history. The Renaissance, the Reformations, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment unfolded at the same time as European empires spread first into the Mediterranean and then across the Atlantic, spurring the growth of global capitalism and the transatlantic slave trade. Political and religious freedoms emerged alongside new forms of persecution, control, and oppression. A divided Europe grew increasingly connected to the rest of the world as commercial goods, people, ideas, and diseases traveled across land and sea. Among the major themes we'll explore are a) how individuals who lived through these tumultuous centuries experienced their changing world and b) how changes in health, disease, and environment - including the Black Death, the Columbian Exchange, and the climactic cooling period known as the Little Ice Age - drove the religious, political, social, and economic upheavals of the late medieval and early modern periods.",

The course will take students from French Revolution that started integrating the Jews into the fabric of European society to the establishment of the State of Israel. It will highlight the plurality of models of Jewish integration and acculturation, the formation of new Jewish identities, the split of the traditional community under the impact of Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment), the rise of Liberal and Orthodox trends within Judaism, and the spread of Jewish political movements such as socialism and nationalism. Based on a plethora of English-language documents, the course will introduce students to those problems of interaction between the general society and the Jewish minority that pointed toward the twentieth century transformation of modernity.  In sum, the course will explore the fascinating response of Jews to modernity on political, societal, theological, and cultural levels.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Storytelling: History and Journalism through Graphic NovelsIn early 2020, nearly six years after local police officers forcibly abducted 43 students of Ayotzinapa rural school in Guerrero, the families shared to the public how they searched for their sons. After countless protests to demand government action and answers, their story came in the form of a graphic novel. Journalist Andalusia K. Soloff spent years with these families investigating the 43 disappeared students and eventually published Vivos se los Llevaron (Taken Alive) to recount their fight for justice. When the story returned to its regional authors, it was accessible to some of the parents of the 43, illiterate community members, and even aired over local airways in Amuzgo for native speakers.In this course we explore how historians and journalists like Andalusia use graphic novels to tell complex, sensitive, and silenced stories. Together we learn and argue that when and where a story starts and who starts it can shape how it's told, why it's told, and what impact it can have. Historical graphic novels have long helped authors communicate crises to broader audiences, but what lessons do they teach us about historical and journalistic research questions and methods? What do graphic novels show us about conflict, justice, and discourse? How are graphic novels expanding history and journalism to make space for new politics of storytelling? How do graphic novels that center women, the environment, or people of color fundamentally change stories?Through reading graphic novels written principally by women and people of color, such as Wake (2021) and Crossroads (2021), students will investigate the historical patterns of three themes--environmental justice, human rights, and gender-based violence--and then write a series of short writing assignments and one final paper. This course also invites guest journalists from leading outlets, such as The Guardian, The NACLA Report on the Americas, and Teen Vogue. All welcome, especially majors from History, Journalism, Environmental Studies, and Latinx Studies.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: History of American MedicineWhy does American medicine look the way it does? The United States spends more on health care than any other country in the world, but is almost singular in its lack of universal health care. American medicine is at once distinguished by its capacity for research and innovation and by its inability to resolve the profound health inequalities that shape this country. Which historical processes produced this unique set of circumstances? When and how have activists, patients, and politicians agitated for change? What alternate futures might we imagine? This course traces the history of American medicine from the nation's founding to the present day. We will learn about the formation of the medical profession, track changing understandings of health and disease, discuss the development of drugs and medical technologies, and investigate the role of professional organizations in combatting efforts to nationalize healthcare. At the same time, we will hear about efforts to reform American medicine in the name of anti-racism, gender equality, decolonization, disability rights, and social justice. By studying these complex histories, we will ask questions about the relationship between health, power, bodies, and knowledge and consider what it has meant to provide care and pursue health throughout American history.",

The primary aim of this course is to prepare each student to discuss verbally and in writing the major themes and problems of early American Indian history.",

By examining the histories of ethnic Koreans in these places, we will explore issues of migration, diaspora, race, policies regarding minorities, and colonialism. We will also take a fresh look at 20th century Korean history, demonstrating how diaspora and emigration are critical to understanding national history.",

Yet, by 1800 - the blink of an eye, in world historical terms - Europe had become the most economically dynamic region of the world, as the emergent social relations of capitalism reordered its states and connected them to different regions of the globe in surprising new ways.

Their negative assessment has remained with us until the present day. This course will grapple with the both the origins of this negative bequest as well as some of the anomalies of the medieval tradition. For example, despite the insistence that heterosexuality was ordained by God, the disparagement of physicality and women led to the institutionalization of clerical celibacy in the West. This, in turn, fostered a gay subculture. Likewise, despite the theoretical insistence on a separation between the sexes that was even present in the afterlife, these same theorists not only praised virile women, but occasionally celebrated cross-dressing in female saints! This course will examine the institutions and ideas that dominated the construction of gender in the Middle Ages. It will also lend insight into not one, but many sexualities.",

During this course we will discuss many of the events from Holocaust history by looking at specific individuals and the choices they willed or were compelled to make. While we will explore primarily the experience of the Jews, we will also consider other victim categories (such as the Roma and Sinti, Slavs, gay men and lesbians, disabled persons, and Jehovah's Witnesses) and the actions of perpetrators and their local collaborators, rescuers, resistors, and bystanders. In the last part of our course we will scrutinize the legacies of the Holocaust during the first postwar years, including the survivors' struggles to rebuild their lives, criminal justice, and restitution and reparations.Our examination of the Holocaust will be based primarily on historical texts of Holocaust scholars as well as on wartime and postwar documents and autobiographical accounts of gentile and Jewish participants in the Holocaust.

    "ClassOverview": "The advent of the Four Modernizations under the aegis of Deng Xiaoping in late 1978 precipitated a series of far-reaching changes in Chinese society, culture, and the economy indeed, almost every aspect of life. At the same time, however, the country's Maoist and more distant Republican and Imperial pasts have continued to inform and shape reform. This course examines the complexities of China's reformist period from the late 1970s until the early 21st century. We will highlight key currents, such as the transformation of rural-urban relations, domestic arguments about the unevenness and morality of socio-economic change, the 1989 Spring Democracy Movement, China's Peaceful Rise, and its growing participation in global affairs, with an eye to understanding new social formations and highlighting the resonance of the past.",

Despite popular narratives of the Midwest as purely a heartland of white homogeneity and normativity, racialized communities of color have long shaped politics, culture, and society in the region. This course emphasizes the fluid nature of ideas about race, and their interplay with the construction of place in a settler colonial society. The course materials cover a wide range of topics that are crucial for understanding both Midwestern and U.S. history writ large. From the multi-ethnic world of the fur trade, to contemporary housing inequalities, this course highlights the making of a U.S. region, and confronts mythologies of the Midwest in the American imagination.",

This debate has been revived in recent years as authoritarian leaders have gained power around the world.Our primary focus will be the fascist regimes that came to power in Italy and Germany, but we will also investigate fascist movements elsewhere, including the United States. Surveying a wide range of fascist movements, we will investigate questions including: Is fascism a single, coherent ideology? Is fascism a form of populism? What is fascism's relationship to imperialism? What is fascism's relationship to capitalism? How did fascists want to reconstruct national, sexual, and racial identities? Who joined fascist movements and why? Who fought fascism and how?Is fascism still a useful concept for helping us to understand contemporary politics, or is it a purely historical phenomenon from the previous century?",

But what do we talk about when we talk about its history?  The central facts about the bomb's use in 1945 who did what to whom and why--- are not in question: The U.S. government detonated two bombs over two Japanese cities in August 1945.  It did so on purpose, intending to cause major damage and loss of life.  Nonetheless, the bomb's development, its use in 1945, and its legacies remain controversial 70 years later in a number of different ways.  This course will take up a different sub-topic each week in order to explore many of the controversies surrounding remembrance of the atomic bomb in the United States, Japan, and globally.A special feature of this course is that half the students will be Hitotsubashi University undergraduates who are in Tokyo.

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Inventing the Age of the SamuraiIf I say the word samurai, you probably get an image of a fierce warrior communing with his sword. That tends to be our contemporary image, reinforced by Hollywood movies, video games, and manga. But the samurai have appeared in all kinds of guises, from the gentle, teary-eyed flute-player to the bored, bloated bureaucrat to the savage, xenophobic zealot. This course is about how the history of the samurai has been written and represented in Japan and the United States. We will start with the first attempts to record the history of Japanese warfare and end with movies and manga. This is a somewhat unconventional approach to the study of historiography (the writing of history). It considers many genres and covers nearly a thousand years of writing, and it focuses on a type of person rather than a period or event. But it has the same objective: to explain how and why the representation of history has changed over time and space.",

We will begin by considering China's place in the world by discussing the 2017 box office hit Wolf Warrior 2 (China's Rambo: First Blood II) and end by considering popular Chinese science fiction.

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: The Age of American Revolutions, 1775-1825: The United States, Haiti, and Latin AmericaThe half century between 1775 and 1825 was an age of American revolutions.  From the shot heard round the world to the independence of Bolivia fifty years later, most of the Western Hemisphere including all of Brazil, all of mainland Spanish America, much of British America, and Haiti broke away from Europe.  People throughout the Americas were rejecting absolutism and embracing constitutionalism, and this new order for the New World raised powerful questions.  How would wars against European authority impact social, racial, and gender hierarchies at home?  How would enslaved men and women respond when they heard their enslavers talking of liberty?  And in the multiracial nations that did emerge, who if anyone would be entitled to vote?  In the process of addressing these questions, we will also focus on the art of historical research: how to find topics, frame research questions, identify and interpret sources, and build arguments.  Students can write their research papers on any of the revolutions that rocked the Western Hemisphere in this era; many in-class discussions will focus on U.S. responses to Haitian and Latin American independence, and on what those responses suggest about the United States in this age of American revolutions.",

Yet the purpose of the autobiography is to tell a story, not history. Thus autobiography is a quintessential narrative that borders on the literary. Is it possible to use autobiography in historical research? This seminar opens up a variety of ways to understand the literary elements in autobiography and to use autobiography as a reliable historical source. This seminar takes students through five hundred years of Jewish ego-narratives that entail the autobiographies of rabbis and mystics, schismatics and philosophers, merchants and writers, dissidents and historians, politicians, converts, extraordinary and ordinary Jews.",

Depending on linguistic abilities and/or the availability of translations, possible topics might include the rise of nationalist ideas and other political mass ideologies, the impact of the social sciences on Islamic scholarship, changing views of sociopolitical progress, and the question of feminism.

These were the people who because of their low social status, rural origins, illiteracy, or unpopular beliefs were ignored, despised, or persecuted by the dominant society. Microhistory is a method of investigation that usually relies on the evidence from judicial trials of otherwise obscure people who found themselves in trouble with the authorities. The method gives a voice to those who otherwise left no written record of their lives. The result of the studies has been a remarkable re-evaluation of the experiences and beliefs of the common people of Europe, the Americas, and Asia.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic:  U.S. State and Society since 1933This seminar will consider the relation between state and society in the United States, with an emphasis on the years since 1932 when state power became increasingly centralized in the national government. It will do so through reading classic and emerging scholarship on the place of state power in creating and maintaining public order through policies of inclusion, exclusion, hierarchy, connection, and conflict. After considering the changing dimensions of state power and organization, it will explore the role of the state as actor in organizing and mediating social categories and ask why social politics often includes efforts to remake or capture the state, thus fostering more capacious and complex understandings of what politics is and how it works. While course readings will focus on the history of the United States, its questions, concepts, and insights should be of value in other geographical and temporal contexts.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Southeast Asia: History & HistoriographyThis seminar is an introduction to the most important figures, works, and debates in the history of modern Southeast Asia.  It begins by considering the arguments for and against regional history and area studies.  It then turns to an assessment of some of the most influential ideas in the study of the region, such as Oliver Wolters's notions of localization, the mandala state, and the man of prowess; Anthony Reid's Age of Commerce; Clifford Geertz's formulation of the theatre state; James C. Scott's analysis of the moral economy of the peasant and weapons of the weak; J.S. Furnivall's notion of the plural society; and Thongchai Winichakul's conception of the geo-body, among others.  Students will gain a critical understanding of the historiography of modern Southeast Asia and some of its most important animating ideas.",

In this course we examine how religions are adapting to an increasingly digital world and how digital environments are shaping old and new religious practices. Through a series of case studies, we will consider how religious practitioners and the spiritual but not religious are using digital media to challenge established religious authority, create community, innovate devotional practices, and theorize their experiences. We will examine, for example, collage and hip hop, virtual pujas, mindfulness apps, user-generated gods, emoji spells, tulpamancy, transhumanism, and Slender Man. Through these case studies we will explore how digital natives and adopters are reimagining religious presence, mediation, community, ethics, and ontology. This class centers BIPOC, queer, and feminist voices, digital arts, memetics, lived religion, and social justice.

    "ClassOverview": "Comparative Approaches to Ancient EmpiresStimulated by current interest in decolonization and globalization, the study of ancient empires is now thriving. A major research trend adopts a comparative, cross-cultural framework to try to understand and explain commonalities and differences, which this course explores. Did the first complex territorial states we call empires emerge and develop in similar ways? What factors or institutions were crucial to their trajectory and success, and what theories have been proposed to account for them? What are the benefits and challenges of a comparative, multidisciplinary perspective, and what new kinds of histories might it produce? Many recent studies compare Rome and Qin/Han China; others consider the historical sequence of empires in the Middle East, such as the Neo-Assyrian and Achaemenid Persian empires; still others analyze aspects of imperial formation and rule in historically unrelated empires in different geographical regions and eras.This course examines selected case studies drawn from a wide geographical and chronological range, with special focus on the ancient Mediterranean and Middle East. We will examine different aspects of territorial expansion, consolidation, and rule, including state ideology, bureaucracy, cosmopolitanism, urbanism, borders and frontiers, religion, and the creation and circulation of the imperial image. Readings will represent contributions by scholars working in different disciplines, including history, art history, and archaeology.",

Despite popular narratives of the Midwest as purely a heartland of white homogeneity and normativity, racialized communities of color have long shaped politics, culture, and society in the region. This course emphasizes the fluid nature of ideas about race, and their interplay with the construction of place in a settler colonial society. The course materials cover a wide range of topics that are crucial for understanding both Midwestern and U.S. history writ large. From the multi-ethnic world of the fur trade, to contemporary housing inequalities, this course highlights the making of a U.S. region, and confronts mythologies of the Midwest in the American imagination.",

    "ClassOverview": "India/Pakistan Partition in Literature, Film, and Popular CultureIn August 1947, as the sun set on Britain's Indian empire, the subcontinent was partitioned into two newly-created, independent nations: India and Pakistan. The division into two territories -one Hindu-majority, the other Muslim-majority - was accompanied by perhaps the largest migration in human history. Millions moved from one territory to the other, often against their will, as hundreds of thousands were killed in the ensuing chaos. The unprecedented violence of Partition - physical, emotional, social - profoundly shaped the national identities of India and Pakistan, permanently restructured the texture of everyday life and altered the global political order. From the subsequent partitioning of Pakistan and Bangladesh in 1971, to enduring border disputes in Kashmir, from ongoing cross-border migration to unresolved conflicts over identity and belonging, Partition continue to shape the region today. Partition's legacy today extends far beyond the heavily-fortified frontier and into the art, literature and popular culture of the three countries that emerged from it. Even as the post-colonial states treated Partition as an aberration best forgotten - a footnote of a midnight tryst with destiny - the arts emerged as the primary space in which the meaning of Partition was negotiated and mediated. What could not easily be engaged directly found its expression, often allegorically, on the silver screen or the off-white pages of literary magazines. This class will examine how Partition has been engaged in literature and popular culture, moving from contemporary depictions from the 1940s to its continued invocation in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh today. We will read/watch these texts alongside the extensive body of scholarship on Partition from History, Anthropology and Gender Studies with particular attention to the historiography of Partition and South Asian nationalisms. Throughout, we will engage with the idea of Partition as an event and ask how Partition continues to inflect life in South Asia and beyond today.",

    "ClassOverview": "The Crime Centered DocumentaryIn this course, we will view non-fiction and hybrid films that revolve around crime, criminal justice, and criminal court cases. Our emphasis will be on cases that are either mired in controversy or emblematic of wider social concerns. Readings will augment viewings as we weigh legal, philosophical, or scientific perspectives: What is accurately depicted? What is omitted? What is misrepresented? Concurrently, we will investigate the films aesthetically: How is the film structured and why? What choices are being made by the filmmaker regarding camera, sound, and editing, and how do these choices affect viewers? Throughout the course, we will consider the ethics of depicting real people and traumatic events. We will also look at specific films in regard to their legal or societal impact.Assignments will include a series of short response papers and a substantial final project, which can take the form of either (up to the student) a ten to twelve-page paper or a six to twelve-minute film/podcast/media project. Projects should center upon a legal topic. Ideas include, but are not limited to, a paper that compares two films depicting the same criminal case or a polished/edited film interview with an individual connected to a crime or involved with the legal system (a defendant, a lawyer, a judge, a policeperson, etc.). Additional topics could center around mitigation films, viral crime videos, local courts, legal advocacy centers, or hybrid crime films.",

    "ClassOverview": "Science and RepresentationWhen you write up a lab report, you probably don't approach it as a literary exercise.  Today we take science writing as an objective, transparent transcription of experimental data.  However, during the Scientific Revolution in Europe and Britain, literary form was vital to the transmission and popularization of new experimental methods. Indeed, literary representation was necessary to help people conceive new sensory worlds at microscopic, sub-microscopic, or planetary scale. We will explore the centrality of literary representation to pivotal new technologies in the early modern emergence of experimental science:  the microscope, the air-pump, the telescope, and the distillation apparatus. These technologies did not only challenge fervently held convictions about the natural world endorsed by the Bible, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, among other authorities. They also demanded new representational modes able to communicate concepts and vivify experiences inassimilable to old ways of understanding.  How can the pervasive agency of atmospheric pressure be figured in language? What words make the magnified body of a flea familiar, even beautiful?  Why poeticize the chemical reactions involved in refining a new global commodity, sugar?  What political viewpoints accompany Copernican visions of possible planetary worlds?We will explore how literary technology was as integral to the New Science as experimental technology.  Throughout, we will approach western science not as universal knowledge but as highly situated practice, whose multifarious economic, extractive, and imperial investments are woven into the fabric of its literary representation. We will dedicate significant time to satires of the new science, whose critical counter-representations of the frivolity, futility, or cruelty of experimental method illuminate the deep and ongoing stakes of science's relation to literature.The class will be broken into interconnected units organized around the air-pump, microscope, distillation apparatus, and telescope.  Literary genres will include descriptions of experiments (including those in a new venue, the scientific journal), treatises, illustrated books, engravings, poems, satires, and plays.",

Along with reading poems that take up the subject, we will read several essays to undergird our discussion of the ethics of representation, positionality, and what it means to write about violence and trauma.

For the past 50 years, U.S. policymakers have struggled to define America's role in an ever more complex world where threats multiply and challenges morph and endure. The period beginning with the Vietnam War traces an arc that reaches from Soviet nuclear arsenals to Islamic suicide bombers, from a fear of falling dominoes in Southeast Asia to hopes for a wave of democracy in the Middle East. And now the rise of right-wing populists in Europe, a newly activist Russia and the presidency of Donald Trump. This course uses an engaging set of examples and materials to chart one of the most intriguing stretches of international engagement in U.S. history. We will work collaboratively to understand why decisions were made, how policies were implemented and sold, and what it all may mean in the end. Assessing sources from presidential speeches and critics' rejoinders to film documentaries and media accounts, we will study goals and motivations, ends and means, in an array of case studies.

    "ClassOverview": "What is Black internationalism? Why has it emerged as a scholarly term and field over the past two decades and become especially dominant in the past five to ten years? What is its relationship to global colonialism, New World slavery, Pan-Africanism, diaspora, and the political and cultural more broadly? This course will aim to provide answers to these questions initially guided by Cedric J. Robinson's idea of the Black Radical Tradition (1983) and Paul Gilroy's idea of the Black Atlantic (1993). How do these texts, if at all, inform the scholarly usage of Black internationalism that comes afterward, namely and perhaps initially in Brent Hayes Edwards' The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism (2003)? How should we account for the persistence of Marxism and the Haitian Revolution within the field of Black internationalism? What about the field's turn toward Black women's historical theorizations of gender and sexuality, and most recently the Black nationalism of Garveyism? Moreover, what does it mean to view these political and cultural histories through a Black internationalist lens? All of these aforementioned questions will form one of two bases to the course; the second is research practices. Given Black internationalism is indebted to scholars in multiple fields Black Studies, History, Political Theory, Cultural Studies, English Literature, and more students will become versed in several disciplinary research and writing practices as a means of aiding their own independent research. Considering my own background in History and Black Studies, we will pay particular attention to the relationship between history and Black critical theory. How do scholars produce research that crosses both of these strands? What is the archive broadly conceived? How does archival work relate to the production of theory and vice versa? Moreover, how do we pursue an empirical and/or theoretical project that is (Black) internationalist in design and execution?",

    "ClassOverview": "What does it mean to be healthy? In this seminar, students will examine how this seemingly simple question becomes more complex when looking at various cultural approaches to medicine, health, and wellness. Important topics that will be covered include indigenous understandings of health, the growth of biomedicine as a dominant paradigm across the globe, and transnational connectivity in addressing emerging health issues. Our discussions of these issues will focus on culture, gender, medicine, race, borders, activism, and (de)colonization. We will also discuss qualitative research methods, with special attention given to online/virtual research methods in an era of restricted international travel. Students will develop a refined research question and explore which methods are best suited to answering this question. Students will complete a polished 13-15 page research paper, with the following assignments spaced throughout the course to develop the paper: a research proposal, rough draft, peer review exercise, and final presentation. Throughout the course, we will engage perspectives from anthropology, history, journalism, political science, and sociology.",

Storytelling has been a staple of Italian literature and culture since the days of Boccaccio,  but the aesthetic,  ethical,  and cultural aspects of the genre certainly have changed in the last century.    Can the modern short story still communicate ethical and social truths?  Is the inherent, conclusive brevity and elegance of the genre paradoxically better able to capture the chaos of contemporary life? We will examine works written in a realistic mode and in a fantastic style.  Moreover, we will discuss the elements that define the two approaches with an emphasis on close reading and on the historical and social context of each text.  We will focus in particular on issues of love, jealousy, sexuality, gender, friendship and youth culture as defined by Boccaccio, Verga, Morante, Ortese, Pavese, Calvino, Tabucchi and Tondelli.",

    "ClassOverview": "(Neo)realism and the Documentary Impulse:Italian cinema has changed the way in which we conceive of the moving image and its relationship to reality in its social, political, and affective dimensions. This course begins with the heyday of Neorealism in the 1940s (Rossellini's war trilogy, De Sica's Bicycle Thieves, and Visconti's The Earth Trembles), placing this defining moment in film history in the context of World War II and the break from the Fascist period. Particular attention will be devoted to questions of gender and race, as the memory of Italy's racial laws and colonial past in Africa was about to be dimmed by the cultural politics of postwar recovery and, later, the economic miracle. Mindful of this process of historical erasure, we will then turn to the remarkable production of the 1960s and 1970s and analyze they way in which different directors (Fellini, Antonioni, Visconti, Rosi, Pasolini) treated the problems of modernity and industrialization, migration, organized crime, and the media industry. Finally, we will assess the return of a documentary approach to reality in films like Garrone's Gomorra (Gomorrah, 2008) and Rosi's Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea, 2016) in the context of the current socio-economic crisis and the resurgence of populism and right-wing politics. Throughout the course, we will also work to acquire the critical and methodological tools necessary to analyze film as a complex mode of cultural production.",

    "ClassOverview": "Gender, Race, and Aesthetic Resistance in Film and Media:This course will focus on films, TV programs, and music videos that expose and attempt to counter the formation of gender and race hierarchies in the fabric of daily life. Our point of departure is Italy's current predicament, which sees the resurgence of right-wing politics and a widespread homophobic and racist stand. Several anti-immigration policies and the recent rejection of the Zan bill (which was meant to make violence against LGBT people and disabled people, as well as misogyny, a hate crime) urge us, yet again, to contest still enduring images of Italy as the land of love and of Italians as basically brava gente (decent people). We will begin by considering the ways in which mass media have contributed to construing gender and race stereotypes at different junctures in Italian history, keeping in mind the longstanding repression of Italy's colonial past in Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. However, the bulk of the course will be devoted to those practices of cultural resistance that developed within commercial film/television production as well as in more lateral or experimental contexts. Among the examples we will consider are Pier Paolo Pasolini's queer documentary, Comizi d'amore (Love Meeetings, 1964); Cecilia Mangini's Essere Donne (Being Women, 1965), a feminist take on Italian Marxism and anthropology; Adriana Monti's Scuola senza fine (School without End, 1983), produced in the context of the experimental 150 hours course; Gianikian and Ricci-Lucchi Dal Polo all'Equatore (From the Pole to the Equator, 1985), which re-edits archival footage of colonial travel and sport from the Fascist period; and contemporary works by Afro-Italian writers and artists such as Gabriella Ghermandi, Dagmawi Yimer, and Karima 2G. We will conclude by addressing the resonances between Afrofuturism and feminist poetics in the US and Italy.",

    "ClassOverview": "Title: Modern Jewish American Literature: Ethnicity, Assimilation, PerformanceThis seminar consists of modern Jewish American literary text analyses in point of their cultural markers, focusing on the relationships between collective and individual memory, mainstream and minority tensions, as well as identity and ethical dilemmas. We intend to focus on the ethnic components of these texts as evidence of cultural assimilation, dissimilation, or performance on the part of the authors who produced them in the U.S. The seminar looks at identity as a contextually-based fluid category, the result of spaces of negotiation. We will compare the representation of Eastern European Jewish experiences in the early twentieth century literature of immigrant authors from the Russian Empire and Romania to the representation of the same early twentieth century experience by contemporary (Jewish) American authors. We will assess how significant moments in the life of early twentieth century Eastern European Jews in America (such as the fusgeyer / marching emigration movement from 1900 Romania, the 1903 Kishinev pogrom from the Russian Empire, the original Bintel Brief/Bundle of Letters column in The Yiddish Daily Forward or the 1911 Triangle Fire in New York) were represented in early twentieth century literary works and how they are represented in contemporary, twenty-first century literary works. In this sense, we will consider the input of the gender lens and various literary genres (play, reportage poem, graphic narrative, travelogue, photo-word novel) looking back on the early twentieth century. We will analyze literary works by Eastern European Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from the Pale of Settlement and Romania at the turn of the twentieth century (Abraham Cahan, Mary Antin, Anzia Yezierska, M.E. Ravage) and literary works rewriting the early 1900s immigrant experience due to contemporary (Jewish) American authors (Liana Finck, Margot Singer, Leela Corman, Jill Culiner, Barbara Kahn, Aleksandar Hemon, Robert Fink, Julia Alekseyeva). By examining moments of struggle and power imbalance in the relation between mainstream and minority groups, the seminar also explores the fundamental role of literature in mourning and historical reparation.",

According to prevalent assumptions, both inside and outside academia, the relationship between Jews and Arabs in these years was characterized by mutual rivalry, violence, and conflict. This course, however, aims to challenge this approach by looking at a diversity of interactions that went beyond the political rivalry between the two communities. Relying on a 'History from Below' approach, we will analyse shared identities and joint experiences, and discuss a wide range of daily encounters and collaborations which took place between ordinary Jews and Arabs in different spheres such as: mixed cities, the education system, business and labor markets, political organizations, leisure spaces and more. Using primary sources, we will examine the myriad ways in which Jews and Arabs formed personal and even romantic relationships in the background of the escalating national struggle.",

From the young and beautiful sorceresses of Greek mythology to the elderly and foul hags of the Roman imagination, the portraits of female magical specialists who populate Latin literature under a wide array of descriptive titles (praecantrix, strix, saga, maga, venefica, etc.) are better studied as cultural constructs that depend upon and reflect particular social contexts and ideological systems. Although ancient sources indicate that men did engage in artes magicae, literary representations of male magicians are fewer and far less horrific than those of female sorceresses and witches. In this course, we will analyze and seek to denaturalize the gendered stereotypes at work in these portraits by reflecting on the underlying anxieties about bodies, identities, and threats to social order that shaped them.",

    "ClassOverview": "Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical, Hamilton, has become a national sensation, capturing the imaginations of Americans young and old, far and wide, of diverse backgrounds and ancestries. A hip hop infused musical, Hamilton is widely considered to have revolutionized the genre of the Broadway musical, just as many saw the American Revolution as a first for the world. There is also a resurgence of interest in Hamilton and Lin-Manuel Miranda, because of the Hamilton movie, put out by Disney+ a year ago, Miranda's recent production of his first musical, In the Heights; and the reopening of Hamilton on Broadway. We'll discuss of these things, in addition to Hamilton's evolving meaning and reception in 2015, when the musical first appeared, and 2021, a very different political and cultural moment in U.S. history. Students in this course will learn, first, about Hamilton's life and times. Easily among the most polarizing figures of a famously polarized generation, Hamilton was a Caribbean-born British subject who became an American revolutionary, a bastard brat who became Treasury Secretary, a man who helped to lead thirteen of Britain's American colonies in a violent independence war only to advocate a financial plan and a foreign policy that presented Britain as a role model. In studying his life and politics, we will also explore early American notions of honor and masculinity, marriage and infidelity, freedom and slavery. As we study Hamilton the man, we will also study Hamilton the musical, attempting to account for its extraordinary contemporary resonance. Why has this past person's continued to inspire such interest today, in a nation that looks so different from the one that Hamilton (and his enemies) knew? Where does the musical diverge from the history, and what does that say about our memory and use of the past? Does the musical offer an inspiring, multiethnic vision of U.S. history or, as some have argued, a more haunting and problematic one?

Easily among the most polarizing figures of a famously polarized generation, Hamilton was a Caribbean-born British subject who became an American revolutionary, a bastard brat who became Treasury Secretary, a man who helped to lead thirteen of Britain's American colonies in a violent independence war only to advocate a financial plan and a foreign policy that presented Britain as a role model. In studying his life and politics, we will also explore early American notions of honor and masculinity, marriage and infidelity, freedom and slavery. As we study Hamilton the man, we will also study Hamilton the musical, attempting to account for its extraordinary contemporary resonance. Why has this past person's continued to inspire such interest today, in a nation that looks so different from the one that Hamilton (and his enemies) knew? Where does the musical diverge from the history, and what does that say about our memory and use of the past? Does the musical offer an inspiring, multiethnic vision of U.S. history or, as some have argued, a more haunting and problematic one? When audiences leave the theater, what do they take away about early America and America today and about themselves?",

    "ClassOverview": "Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical, Hamilton, has become a national sensation, capturing the imaginations of Americans young and old, far and wide, of diverse backgrounds and ancestries. A hip hop infused musical, Hamilton is widely considered to have revolutionized the genre of the Broadway musical, just as many saw the American Revolution as a first for the world. There is also a resurgence of interest in Hamilton and Lin-Manuel Miranda, because of the Hamilton movie, put out by Disney+ a year ago, Miranda's recent production of his first musical, In the Heights; and the reopening of Hamilton on Broadway. We'll discuss of these things, in addition to Hamilton's evolving meaning and reception in 2015, when the musical first appeared, and 2021, a very different political and cultural moment in U.S. history.

    "ClassOverview": "The surge in the Latino/a population has brought about profound economic, educational, and political implications for states, cities and the U.S. polity. As their electoral clout continues to grow, as evidenced by recent elections, Latinos/as will have the opportunity to exert greater influence in the politics and policies of our country. This course will explore these implications and the histories, including the more contemporary social and political developments of Latino communities, in the United States from a comparative framework. We will focus on the political experiences of America's three largest groups of Latino-origin: Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans. The first part of the course will examine the social construction of Latino identities and trace the historical experiences of all three groups, comparing the elements behind each group's migration and how those processes affect their incorporation in mainstream society. We also examine demographic resources and the impact of immigration on the politics of the Latino collective. Next, we turn to the development of a Latino politics, placing special emphasis on political attitudes, mobilization strategies and electoral participation. Lastly, we tackle public policy issues such as voting rights and language policy. The question that we will return to throughout the course is the degree to which and under what circumstances it is appropriate to speak of a Latino community.",

Students will engage with different forms of texts ranging from court trial transcripts to novels to interrogate the sociopolitical practices that inscribe differential meanings onto the body. We will explore what constitutes the body, how it is constructed, experienced, and re/claimed, as we work towards a more expansive understanding of what is violence and what is read as violent. Privileging the black and brown body as an archive and as a site of knowing, we will discuss how the body, through individual and collective struggles, informs acts of resistance.",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar will apply a linguistic anthropological approach to understanding how social facts are determined by historical trajectories and, in parallel, how events in the past are narrated into history via a set of specific discursive and social processes. We will identify historical ideologies embedded in understandings of colonization in the Caribbean, the struggle for Indigenous rights in the Andes, and radical political thought in the US, and find points of intersection between them. We will consider their impact in subject formation by attending to their social, political, and economic effects. Because a monopoly over truth (and especially historical truth) has been central to the forms of power and authority that undergird ongoing systems of neocolonialism, we will consider the actors and institutions that develop, codify, and transmit notions that individuals as members of different social collectivities believe to be true. What can we learn about how truth settles, and thus unlearn some of the exclusionary practices embedded within the production of knowledge? The course will seek to develop a methodology that pairs linguistic and discursive analyses with basic ethnographic approaches. Focus topics will include colonization, social media, and governance.",

    "ClassOverview": "What role has archaeology played in the emergence and consolidation of modern nation-states in the Americas? Across the world, states use monuments and archaeological artifacts to present national narratives in museums, ancient sites, and online platforms. In the Americas, nation-states have controlled who has access to the material remains from the past while transforming buildings, historic places, monuments, and artifacts into national patrimony. In the process of creating national patrimony, nation-states often estrange Indigenous communities from their landscapes and their cultural heritage.In this course, we will examine the role of archaeology in the creation and preservation of national identities in the Americas from the 18th century to the present. In weekly readings and discussions, we will learn about the institutionalization of archaeology as a state-sponsored discipline, the development of archaeological sites as national monuments and tourist destinations, the display and interpretation of artifacts in museums and heritage sites, and the monopolization of tangible cultural heritage by the state. Ultimately, we will evaluate the intersections of identity and politics throughout the history of Latin America.",

Is the rule of law a meaningful aspiration for a legal system that is fair and ensures everyone, including government officials are equally accountable? Or is the phrase a cynical ruse on behalf of the powerful to control wealth, territory, and populations? This course will explore the origins of the rule of law in European political thought and compare selected theorists' descriptions of the relation between law and politics. The course will focus substantively on the use of state violence and civil penalties in contexts of war, families, and corporations, including the university. The jurisprudence of U.S. statutory interpretation will be explored through analysis of debates about the implementation of national security and sexual harassment policies. The theoretical frameworks of Walter Benjamin, Friedrich Hayek, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Jacques Derrida, Catherine MacKinnon, Max Weber, and Janet Halley will be compared for their usefulness in understanding the interpretation of contemporary laws and imagining alternatives.This class introduces students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. The objective is to improve basic legal literacy in the context of larger questions of political and legal theory. Skills student learn include legal research using online databases, including LexisUni, and Proquest Congressional research databases, as well as how to understand the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations. Students learn these skills in the context of reflecting on larger principles of statutory interpretation -- does a law mean what the plain text says, what Congress intends, or a purpose imputed to law by judges?Please note that there are no formal prerequisites, but students who have not had previous classes in political theory may find this class challenging.

Our emphasis will be on cases that are either mired in controversy and/or emblematic of wider social concerns. Readings will accompany viewings and experts will weigh in with legal, philosophical or scientific perspectives: What is accurately depicted? What is omitted? What is misrepresented? Concurrently, we will investigate the films aesthetically: How is the film structured and why? What choices are being made by the filmmaker in terms of camera, sound and editing and how do these choices affect viewers? Throughout the course, we will consider the ethics of depicting real people and traumatic events. We will also look at specific films in regard to their legal or societal impact.Assignments will include a series of short response papers and a substantial final project, which can take the form of either (up to the student) a 10-12 page paper or an 6-12 minute film/podcast/media project. Projects should center upon a legal topic. Ideas include, but are not limited to, a paper that compares two films depicting the same criminal case or a polished/edited film interview with an individual connected to a crime or involved with the legal system (a defendant, a lawyer, a judge, a policeperson, etc.). Additional topics could center around mitigation films, viral crime videos, local courts, legal advocacy centers, or hybrid crime films.",

Also taught as Poli_Sci 343-0-20 and Intl_St 390-0-20.This course explores how the international legal system works from a legal and political perspective, shaping international relations today. At its core international law is an idea about how to use the tools of law and legal systems to facilitate peaceful and mutually beneficial relations in the world. The course introduces some aspects of the method and substance of international law, such as concepts like sovereign immunity, jus cogens, customary international law, general principles of international law, principles of jurisdiction etc. But this is not a law course. We cover legal subjects to understand how politics and law interact in shaping international relations today. Substantively, the course examines international laws related to the oceans, the environment, human rights, trade and war. We read treaties, and use case studies to see how international law is made, why national governments and national courts at times contest international law, and why international law can be difficult to enforce. We explore the legal and political issues surrounding contemporary flashpoints in international relations: China's claims to the South China Seas, how civil conflict is fueling the poaching of elephants, the United States Supreme Court's ambivalence regarding international law, how international law regarding torture is and is not politically relevant.",

How does learning a first language (or more than one language) interact with learning to think, learning to imagine, and developing a sense of identity?

We will be discussing: a) Who gets to vote? A brief history of the franchise in the USA; b) What is a voting system? Differences between single member and multiple member voting; Apportionment; c) The shape of voting districts: Gerrymandering in America.

According to prevalent assumption, both inside and outside academia, the relationship between Jews and Arabs in those years was solely characterized by mutual rivalry, violence, and conflict. This course, however, aims to challenge this approach by looking at diverse interactions that went beyond the political rivalry between the two communities. Relying on a 'History from Below' approach, we will analyze shared identities and joint experiences, and discuss a wide range of daily encounters and collaborations which took place between ordinary Jews and Arabs in different spheres such as: mixed cities, education system, business and labor market, political organizations, leisure spaces and more. Using historical primary sources, we will examine the myriad ways in which Jews and Arabs formed personal and even romantic relationships in the background of the escalating national struggle.",

    "ClassOverview": "Stimulated by current interest in decolonization and globalization, the study of ancient empires is now thriving. A major research trend adopts a comparative, cross-cultural framework to try to understand and explain commonalities and differences, which this course explores. Did the first complex territorial states we call empires emerge and develop in similar ways? What factors or institutions were crucial to their trajectory and success, and what theories have been proposed to account for them? What are the benefits and challenges of a comparative, multidisciplinary perspective, and what new kinds of histories might it produce? Many recent investigations compare Rome and Qin/Han China; others consider the historical sequence of empires in the Middle East, such as the Neo-Assyrian and Achaemenid Persian empires; still others analyze characteristics of imperial formation and rule in historically unrelated empires in different geographical regions and eras.This course examines selected case studies drawn from a wide geographical and chronological range, with special focus on the ancient Mediterranean and Middle East. We will examine different aspects of territorial expansion, consolidation, and rule, including state ideology, bureaucracy, cosmopolitanism, urbanism, borders and frontiers, religion, and the creation and circulation of the imperial image. Readings will represent contributions by scholars working in different disciplines, including history, art history, and archaeology.",

We all want to know how the mind works in health and what happens when things go wrong in disease. However, first we need to start with the fundamentals, which this course will provide. Learning about neuroscience is like learning a new language, which will require the introduction of new words and the memorization of terminology. Students will be expected to increase their vocabulary so that they can begin to appreciate and discuss neuroscience concepts and research in an informed manner. This is not a survey course, rather it is designed to provide a solid foundation for subsequent coursework that delves more deeply into various topics in neuroscience.Prerequisites: Must be a neuroscience major, and either BIOL_SCI 217-0 or BIOL_SCI 215-0, BIOL_SC 201-0 and either; CHEM 151-0 or CHEM 171-0 with a B- grade or above; or CHEM 132-0 or CHEM 152-0 or CHEM 172-0.Course content is divided into three sections. The first third focuses on the ionic and molecular basis of generating electric signals in neurons. The second third focuses on electrical and chemical communication between neurons, how these connections are adjusted, and how they develop. The final third focuses on simple circuits that illustrate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that allow us to taste, smell, see, hear, feel and move.NEUROSCI 202-0 will be offered again Fall 2022 and Winter 2023.",

The first is David Hume's An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morality (1777), which Hume considered the best thing he ever wrote, and which is now considered a masterpiece of philosophical prose.  In that work, Hume argues that the object of morality are mental qualities that are useful or agreeable to ourselves or others.  The second is Friedrich Nietzsche's late work Twilight of the Idols (1888), which is written in a highly polished aphoristic style, and serves as a kind of epitome of Nietzsche's critique of morality as opposed to nature and hostile to life.  We will engage in close reading of both texts, which are short enough that we should be able to read and discuss them in their entirety.",

    "ClassOverview": "In this course we will discuss philosophical questions about the nature of the self, raised and answered in readings from the history of philosophy and contemporary philosophical writings, as well as some artistic representations. Thus we may discuss questions such as: Is self-awareness necessary or sufficient for selfhood? What guarantees the continuity of personal identity over time? To what degree is the self constituted by its social context? Are there good or bad (authentic/inauthentic, alienated, unified, etc.) ways to be a self? As with any first-year seminar, the course will also involve frequent writing assignments, including both informal exercises and formal argumentative papers.",

For example: What does it take for a system of sentences to count as a good scientific theory? What does it take for a scientific theory to be testable by observational and experimental data (and, by the way: what does it take for certain series of experiences to count as data or observations?)? What does it take for a given theory to be better supported by the available evidence than its competitors? What does it take for a given theory to explain the known phenomena in an area of knowledge? What does it take for an explanatory scientific theory to be credited with reference to underlying structures of reality? We will begin with a brief overview of the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17 th century, and then turn to the treatment of certain problems in the contemporary literature, like the problem of induction, the problem of the underdetermination of theory choice by the available data, the problem of rationality and conceptual change, the problem of realism.",

Much of what Aristotle has to say on these topics is significant and of continued importance for contemporary debates in ethics and moral psychology. The course will study the work in detail.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course provides a thorough reading of the conception of empirical knowledge laid out in the first part of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (the Analytic). The seminar will also relate Kant's arguments to issues in more recent philosophical debates. E.g.: Kant qualified his philosophy as transcendental idealism and empirical realism. According to Kant, it evades the choice between saying that we must have an unconceptualized access to reality in order to have factual knowledge (so that it is hard to say how we as concept-using knowers can know reality at all) on the one hand, and saying that the reality our factual knowledge represents is determined by our concepts (so that it is hard to say in what way reality is a mind-independent constraint on belief). Kant suggests that this is a non-issue if there is only one universal set of concepts constitutive of all (genuinely fact-enabling) human experience. But the course of scientific progress since reveals this as a big (and unfulfilled) IF: in light of the diversity of experience and of the sciences, it is not easy to insist that there is only one set of forms of all possible objects of experience, one set of categories to form judgments, one set of principles to form natural laws. But the impasse confronted in Kant's epistemological analysis persists --for each of the variegated forms. Can Kant's conception of experience and empirical knowledge still help us understand how we can claim to know mind-independent reality? Another example: Much of contemporary philosophy of mind centers on the question of the relation between mind and reality. Kant criticized all such attempts at founding factual knowledge on self-knowledge (which lead into paralogisms) or knowledge of unconceptualised reality in itself (which lead to antinomies). His arguments compel realizing that both (reality as such and a directly present foundational 'inner' self) can't be objects of knowledge at all (=are non-objects). Does this dissolve the problems of mind and reality or rather make them cognitively insolvable?",

    "ClassOverview": "In this course, we will examine the main features of the philosophical paradigm of hermeneutics that Heidegger articulates in Being and Time. The key to Heidegger's paradigm shift is the generalization of hermeneutics from a method of textual interpretation to a way of understanding human identity. The hermeneutic paradigm offers a radically different understanding of what is distinctive about human beings: to be human is not primarily to be a rational animal, but first and foremost to be a self-interpreting animal. In order to assess the explanatory power of hermeneutic philosophy and its limits, our seminar will undertake three tasks. First, we will analyze Being and Time's hermeneutic conception of human identity and its main philosophical consequences. To get a sense of the full explanatory potential of Heidegger's hermeneutics we will then analyze Gadamer's dialogical model of interpretation as elaborated in his Truth and Method as well as contemporary accounts that engage with the hermeneutic approach, like those of Miranda Fricker, Ronald Dworkin, Danielle Allen, and Robert Brandom. Third, we will explore the potential limits of the hermeneutic paradigm through an analysis of challenging approaches such as ideology critique and critical race theory, and the possibilities of articulating a critical hermeneutics along the lines of Habermas's democratic turn' in critical theory.",

    "ClassOverview": "In this seminar, we will read some of Kant's works concerning human history and human nature. We will be concerned to understand and investigate Kant's defense of teleological explanation in biology - organic nature should be understood as organized purposively, parts or aspects of beings as directed towards ends - as well as his various claims concerning the nature of human history. For example: does history have a purpose, and if so, which, and how could we know of it?  What kind of description, knowledge, understanding is appropriate to history as an object (are there laws of history, for example)?  We will also investigate the relationship among these doctrines: given Kant's use of biological terminology in his history writings, on his view is historical investigation strongly akin to biological explanation, or based upon biological premises?  Or does human freedom or rationality disrupt biology, rendering history distinct from nature? All of these doctrines intersect with Kant's well-known racism: he develops his biological theory of race while working on his philosophy of biology, and his racist claims in that context are connected to historical views concerning human cultural and moral development. Thus, we will also investigate whether or Kant's concept of race is a teleological-biological or historical concept (or both), and to what degree or how this concept, and Kant's racist commitments, are integral to his thinking concerning biology and history.",

The legal commitments that governments make with each other become the context and the language for political struggles. This seminar examines the key concepts and practices of international law and looks at their connection with politics. The class will cross the line between political science and legal scholarship, and draws cases, readings, and debates from both. The seminar also invests in cultivating good research skills and critical thinking for college and beyond. It develops over several assignments a research project that results in a paper on politics and international law. We also address citation style, avoiding plagiarism, research strategies, and paper structure.",

    "ClassOverview": "The phrase rule of law conveys a range of expectations we have of government and each other. Is the rule of law a meaningful aspiration for a legal system that is fair and ensures everyone, including government officials are equally accountable? Or is the phrase a cynical ruse on behalf of the powerful to control wealth, territory, and populations? This course will explore the origins of the rule of law in European political thought and compare selected theorists' descriptions of the relation between law and politics. The course will focus substantively on the use of state violence and civil penalties in contexts of war, families, and corporations, including the university. The jurisprudence of U.S. statutory interpretation will be explored through analysis of debates about the implementation of national security and sexual harassment policies. The theoretical frameworks of Walter Benjamin, Friedrich Hayek, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Jacques Derrida, Catherine MacKinnon, Max Weber, and Janet Halley will be compared for their usefulness in understanding the interpretation of contemporary laws and imagining alternatives.This class introduces students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. The objective is to improve basic legal literacy in the context of larger questions of political and legal theory. Skills student learn include legal research using online databases, including LexisUni, and Proquest Congressional research databases, as well as how to understand the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations. Students learn these skills in the context of reflecting on larger principles of statutory interpretation -- does a law mean what the plain text says, what Congress intends, or a purpose imputed to law by judges?Students must be prepared to discuss readings and respond to instructor queries during class meetings. Mandatory first class attendance.Please note that there are no formal prerequisites, but students who have not had previous classes in political theory may find this class challenging.

We will focus on the political experiences of America's three largest groups of Latino-origin: Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans.The first part of the course will examine the social construction of Latino identities and trace the historical experiences of all three groups, comparing the elements behind each group's migration and how those processes affect their incorporation in mainstream society. We also examine demographic resources and the impact of immigration on the politics of the Latino collective. Next, we turn to the development of a Latino politics, placing special emphasis on political attitudes, mobilization strategies and electoral participation. Lastly, we tackle public policy issues such as voting rights and language policy.The question that we will return to throughout the course is the degree to which and under what circumstances it is appropriate to speak of a Latino community.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course focuses on the forces shaping countries' foreign economic policies. Why do governments choose to protect some industries behind high tariff walls while leaving others exposed to the vagaries of international competition? Why do most countries in the world rely on the U.S. dollar for their primary reserve currency - and will the dollar continue to serve that function? Why have many countries removed barriers to cross-border financial flows - and what are the social and political consequences of global financial market openness? Does international trade and investment make military conflict less or more likely? Do economic sanctions even work? How have the series of economic crises over the past decade - the 2008-09 financial market meltdown in the U.S., the global credit crunch the followed, sovereign debt crises (in the Eurozone countries and elsewhere), and the severe, synchronized economic downturns that followed the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic - shifted the distribution of global economic and political power? In this course we will develop an analytical toolkit to provide some insight into these and other questions, paying particular attention to evaluating the theoretical arguments with two types of evidence: qualitative and historical and quantitative and cross-national. The course is organized thematically. We start with an introduction to the study of International Political Economy (IPE) and explore why it is distinct from international economics; following the introduction to the course we will discuss the problem of international cooperation when national economic policies have spillover effects. The next three topics (weeks 2-6) are devoted to three of the main issue areas that concern IPE specialists: the politics of the international trade, monetary, and financial systems. We then turn our attention to economic development strategies pursued by low- and middle-income countries and the role of foreign development aid in promoting growth. The last two weeks of the course are devoted to the relationship between transnational economic linkages and conflict and to the rise of new economic powerhouses (namely, China) and the possible consequences of this shift for American influence in global economic affairs.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course explores how the international legal system works from a legal and political perspective, shaping international relations today. At its core, international law is an idea about how to use the tools of law and legal systems to facilitate peaceful and mutually beneficial relations in the world. The course introduces some aspects of the method and substance of international law, such as concepts like sovereign immunity, jus cogens, customary international law, general principles of international law, principles of jurisdiction etc. This is not a law course; we cover legal subjects to understand how politics and law interact in shaping international relations today.

    "ClassOverview": "This course teaches how think critically, comparatively, and globally about the intersections of religion, law, and politics. It is organized around a set of legal cases and supporting materials curated by Professor Hurd and Professor Winnifred Sullivan which are available through the open access Teaching Law and Religion Case Study Archive. Rather than taking the US as the paragon of religious freedom and considering whether the rest of the world lives up to US standards, the course approaches the United States as one among many societies living amidst religious diversity. We study these dynamics comparatively, examining the ways in which religious, legal, and political traditions intersect, interact and co-constitute. A second objective is to connect these cases to local (Northwestern, Evanston, Chicago, Illinois, and US) communities and concerns, focusing on religion, race, and indigeneity. This contributes to an effort to strengthen Northwestern's Center for Native American and Indigenous Research and realize the objectives of the Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion by including substantial course content on African American, Native American, and Jewish American political/religious history and experience. The course traverses disciplinary, geographic, and secular-religious boundaries, drawing on readings from politics, socio-legal studies, religious studies, indigenous studies, anthropology, history, and popular culture. Students will consider their own experiences of living with religious diversity as we explore strategies to think religion anew in the contemporary world. The teaching modules used in this course were developed under the auspices of two research projects supported by the Henry R. Luce Initiative on Religion and International Affairs and the course itself with the support of a Provost's Faculty Grant for Innovation in Diversity and Equity.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course approaches the study of sociological institutions--often referred to as the rules of the game--from a design perspective using in-class exercises and applications. We'll work to understand how these institutions emerge and address existing societal problems, ultimately analyzing the potential of different institutional configurations to encourage or discourage desired outcomes. We focus on both coordination-type dilemmas (e.g. how to parent, which side of the street to drive on, who provides health care) and collective-action dilemmas (e.g. how to police fishermen going over quota, funding of public radio). We end with a study of how institutions persist--possibly beyond their useful lifespan--such as the persistence of the intentionally inefficient 'QWERTY' keyboard, and a conversation about why it's difficult to enact policy change. The course has two overarching goals. This first is to develop a new way of approaching and analyzing social institutions. The second is to build skills in critical analysis though case studies and applications with a local Evanston institution.POLI_SCI 388-0 and SOCIOL 288-0 are taught together; may not receive credit for both courses.",

We will draw from literature that underscores the criminalization of queer life, particularly the hyper-criminalization of queer communities of color, but this course will also move beyond mechanisms of criminalization by asking critical questions about queer illegalism and its capacity to destabilize an existing political world. Reading within historical studies of criminality in the social sciences, specifically anthropology and political science, we will consider queer criminality as a departure from other interpretations of crime as - for instance - pathological, symptomatic, opportunistic, reactionary, constructed, or in collusion with legitimate political and economic orders. While still attending to these themes through keys texts in the study of crime, this course reflects on how conceptualizations of political transgression and crime have been historically transformed and renewed through queer thought and approaches, particularly through figures such as the deviant, the outlaw, or the rebel. We will discuss these figures within theorizations of broader political transgression, such as social movements, uprisings, and revolutions.",

From its role in the founding of the United Nations and the International Criminal Court, many see human rights as a force of progress. At the same time, the universalistic aspirations behind the human rights movements have long been attacked as ethno-centric, philosophically incoherent, and dangerously unrealistic. This course studies the theoretical, practical, and legal arguments for and against using human rights as vehicle for change in international politics. Drawing on historical and contemporary cases from around the world, the course will survey the actors and organizations, including states, corporations, and non-state actors, involved in the promotion of human rights around the globe. We will also review potential issues, such as competing conceptions of human rights, whether human rights are universal, problems of enforcement, and the role of human rights in foreign policy. Throughout, we consider a variety of perspectives, including: liberal, realist, feminist, postcolonial, and other critical approaches concerned with human rights institutions and ideologies.",

We draw on these cases to explore racial contests for political power and representation; intergroup conflicts and coalition building; racial biases in governance and democratic responsiveness, including policing; patterns of socioeconomic mobility; and policies to address racial and economic inequalities. Our overarching aim will be to understand how two dominant features of American life--race and place--interplay and shape the quest for political power, policy influence, and equality in American cities.",

    "ClassOverview": "Poli Sci 395: Political Research Seminar: Science and Knowledge in Global Climate GovernanceDespite decades of climate science research, current climate action remains limited in its ability to effectively mitigate the impacts of climate change. Efforts to reduce emissions are well-intentioned attempts to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, but have yet to spur the magnitude of action required. In this course we will explore the intersections of climate science, traditional ecological knowledge, and climate justice to unpack how different knowledge systems inform and impact effective climate governance and policy. Often unrecognized in science and policy arenas, traditional ecological knowledge generates insights for strengthening efforts to effectively address climate change. In this course, we ask: to what extent and how do different knowledge systems gain and lose traction in different climate policy arenas? How, why, and with what effects are the science and policy of climate change far removed from the people most vulnerable to its impacts? Is the exclusivity of science marginalization of knowledge systems and extricating climate science from climate change experiences the greatest threat to effective climate action? And, how might policy arenas facilitate the introduction, deliberation, and circulation of plural worldviews and knowledge systems?In this research seminar, students will directly engage with an ongoing collaborative research project that seeks to answer these questions. The seminar is structured to reflect the research process. Students enrolled in this course should consider themselves research apprentices and collaborators. There are three parts to this course: literature review, data analysis, and execution. In the first part of the course, we begin by first identifying and engaging with the empirical puzzles around science and knowledge in global climate governance to formulate a series of questions that emerge from these puzzles. We will engage the literature on global climate governance, climate policy, and knowledge politics, explore different research methods and approaches, including ethnography, content and discourse analysis, and quantitative interpretation of qualitative data. Each student will then conduct a mini-literature review on one of our broader questions and propose a research question, hypothesis (argument), and methodological strategy for carrying out the research. In the second part of the course, we will work to develop data collection and analysis skills. In the third part of the course, we complete the execution of the project, with each student developing and strengthening analytical writing skills by producing an original research paper.",

    "ClassOverview": "As nationalist rhetorics, parties, and politicians ascend to positions of authority in regimes worldwide, political theorists are debating the meanings, etiologies, and treatments of nationalism and, relatedly, a resurgent antipathy toward immigrants. This course reviews key political and anthropological theories of membership in political societies since antiquity to address foundational questions about political membership, such as: why do all political societies use birth (jus sanguinis or jus soli) as the paradigmatic decision rule for membership? What are the implications of this decision rule for attachments of nationality, ethnicity, race, and religion? What are the similarities and differences among these groups, heuristically and politically? What is the intellectual history of the nation and the claims that it is modern? Is the nation an inherently toxic form of membership that produces unjustified exclusions at best and genocide at worst? Or is there a form of national belonging that cultivates empathy and mutual care among economically and otherwise unequal members, such that the nation may and should be preserved but should be isolated from its adverse effects? The course will review G.W.F Hegel's attack on social contract theories of belonging and war. We will conclude by reading queer and post-colonial criticisms and defenses of native or indigenous nations and communities. Authors we will read to engage questions about the uses and disadvantages of political societies using birthright for membership, with special attention to the implications of the nation for state violence, include: Plato, Aristotle, John Locke, Immanual Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Emile Durkheim, Claude Levi-Strauss, Hannah Arendt, Joseph Carens, Bonnie Honig, Paul Gilroy, Yasmin Soysal, Ratna Kapur, Rahman, Momin, Audra Simpson, Bruno Perreau, Engin Isin, and Rebecca Tuvel.",

It is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview or broad survey of the general topic. Rather, it offers a curated look at a selection of important themes, topics, and questions. Are the sources and structures of inequality in the United States cross-nationally distinctive? In what ways does it make sense to say that broad patterns of social and political conflict over economic distribution have shifted historically in response to underlying transformations of the American economy? To the extent that the fruits of American prosperity were more equally distributed among white Americans after the Second World War, compared to any period before or since, what has led to the alarmingly high level of economic inequality and political polarization that is plainly evident in our time? Why has Black protest against racial inequality since the late-1960s (not coincidentally the moment in time when the federal government laid the policy foundations of mass incarceration) largely taken the form of urban rebellion? What do ordinary Americans today think about economic inequality, and why have American elites nevertheless been able to continue amassing ever greater amounts of power and wealth? Among the assigned readings are Piketty's Capital and Ideology, Levy's Ages of American Capitalism, Prasad's Land of Too Much, Hacker and Pierson's American Amnesia, Phillips-Fein's Fear City, Hinton's America on Fire, Kruse and Zelizer's Fault Lines, McCall's The Undeserving Rich, and Wessel's Only the Rich Can Play. (Please note that the list of assigned readings may change before the start of the quarter.) Strong pedagogical emphasis will be placed on learning how to read books closely and critically.

People's concepts of these systems would be confused if they failed to grasp the fact that there is no end to these numbers. However, most people have great difficulty understanding infinite sets like these. Are there more positive integers than positive even integers? Are there more rational numbers than natural numbers? Are there more real numbers than rational numbers? You might be surprised at the correct answers to some of these questions. To set the stage, we'll look (informally) at some of the math background on infinity, as developed by Georg Cantor and others in the 19th Century. Then we'll examine some reasons why thinking and reasoning about infinity is so difficult. We'll read some cognitive psychology experiments that address how children first learn about the infinity of the positive integers, how they learn about infinite divisibility, and how older students (NU undergrads) think about number systems in general.",

We will begin at the very beginning of life and learn the biological and environmental influences that help to shape people's personalities over time. We will look at the basic building blocks of temperament and how they these fundamental characteristics of children develop into the major personality characteristics of adults. We will seek to answer questions about what motivates us, how we manage our emotions internally and in social settings, and how we interact as social beings. We will also look at ways in which personality traits may be stable over time or may be susceptible to change. Finally, we will examine the relation between personality and mental health. In what ways do different personality characteristics predispose us to or protect us from the development of psychopathology? What does it mean to have a disordered personality?In this course, we will use both a book that will serve as our primary text and additional required articles that will include research and theoretical articles. Both sources of reading will be critical for understanding this course and (especially information from the book) will not be fully covered in lectures. The research articles may be challenging if you have never read a psychology article before, and I will go over what you need to know and allow time for questions about these articles in class. Class will also cover material that is not explicitly in the readings and will include examples and discussions that will be instrumental to your ability to master the material.

Relationships? Life challenges? How do people create a sense of meaning in their lives? What types of situations encourage cognitive mastery and creativity? How do we, as a society, encourage generosity and altruism?Students will read a mix of recent scientific journal articles and book chapters, will write discussion questions and take part in team exercises relevant to theory and data pertaining to positive psychology, will journal about their own experiences in trying to apply the findings of positive psychology in weekly well-being exercises, and will design their own positive psychology intervention.

Is beauty really in the eye of the beholder? How are gender roles and sexual orientation related to beauty and its pursuit? How do racism and classism shape our beauty ideals and ideas? Why is beauty associated with femininity? What cultural biases help those perceived as beautiful and hurt those perceived as lacking in beauty? Are beautiful people happier or more successful? How do cultural standards of beauty affect disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and body dysmorphic disorder?

    "ClassOverview": "Languages across the globe vary in how they classify experience. Do these variations in linguistic classification affect the way people think? The Whorfian hypothesis expresses the idea that linguistic classification influences not only how we talk about the world, but also how people think about the world even when not speaking. This view suggests that differences across languages mold the thoughts of their users.The Whorfian hypothesis was investigated in the 1960s and then (for reasons we'll discuss) it fell seriously out of favor. But in the last decade, there has been considerable new evidence on the issue of whether and how language may influence the way we think. In this class we will consider the evidence both for and against the idea that language influences cognition. In so doing we will delineate different ways in which language might interact with cognition. We will read papers that compare semantic structures across languages, as well as empirical papers that test whether these semantic differences matter in nonlinguistic tasks, and whether these differences matter in children's cognitive development. The domains to be covered range widely, but may include space, time, theory of mind, object concepts, and causation.",

The course also provides a concise introduction to key concepts in Buddhism (with minimal discussion of the evolution of different Buddhist schools and sects) and how these ideas relate to topics from main-stream Psychology. As students work through the material, we will examine how the critical Buddhist observation of interdependence, especially of all living beings and their environment, leads to an ethical system based on the view that harming others is also harming oneself. Implications of these foundational concepts will be investigated in relation to class materials.",

In the United States, partisanship has surged in recent decades, especially in terms of disdain for opposing partisans. Although such trends are complex and multiply determined, psychology affords a particularly expansive vantage point for making sense of them. This course provides a graduate-level survey of moral and political psychology to help us understand today's politicians and the body politic. By the end of the course, students should be knowledgeable about, and capable of generating original research in, this research space",

This course will give you such a background. Its goal is to introduce the major biological systems of interest in health psychology, and give you the skills to interpret and conduct research that's done on them. To facilitate this, the course will:1. Explore the anatomy and physiology underlying the autonomic, endocrine, cardiac, vascular, and immune systems2. Introduce the methods used to measure these systems, and critically evaluate their strengths and weaknesses3. Evaluate the evidence linking psychological characteristics to biological mechanisms and disease outcomes",

In the first weeks of the course, we look back in time to understand how the ideas about religion that are familiar to us today are rooted in history. The emergence of the concept of religion as an object of comparison and study grew out of early modern European sectarian violence and colonial overseas expansion. We then turn to study some thinkers from the 19th and 20th centuries who developed theories about the best ways to study religion. These scholars developed and honed the fields of sociology, anthropology, and psychology by testing their methods on case studies about religion. To know this history is to know our present, as well as to understand the methodologies that shape the university curriculum. What do we do with this legacy? Are these methods adequate to understanding religion today? In the second half of this class, we critically evaluate these methods by putting them to work to analyze religion in the world, both past and present. We will focus on how religion moves people. People are rooted in space and place by their religious practices, while simultaneously being moved by religion. As will have become clear in the first half of the course, religion is a moving target because people themselves do not stay the same. Throughout the course, we track the tension between rootedness and mobility by examining three themes: conversion, borderlands, and death/afterlives.",

In the first weeks of the course, we look back in time to understand how the ideas about religion that are familiar to us today are rooted in history. The emergence of the concept of religion as an object of comparison and study grew out of early modern European sectarian violence and colonial overseas expansion. We then turn to study some thinkers from the 19th and 20th centuries who developed theories about the best ways to study religion. These scholars developed and honed the fields of sociology, anthropology, and psychology by testing their methods on case studies about religion. To know this history is to know our present, as well as to understand the methodologies that shape the university curriculum. What do we do with this legacy? Are these methods adequate to understanding religion today? In the second half of this class, we critically evaluate these methods by putting them to work to analyze religion in the world, both past and present. We will focus on how religion moves people. People are rooted in space and place by their religious practices, while simultaneously being moved by religion. As will have become clear in the first half of the course, religion is a moving target because people themselves do not stay the same. Throughout the course, we track the tension between rootedness and mobility by examining three themes: conversion, borderlands, and death/afterlives.",

We explore the major doctrinal varieties of Buddhism, from its inception through the rise of the Mahayana and Tantric or Vajrayana traditions.

In the process we engage themes like the meaning of suffering, the cosmology of cyclical rebirth, the social role of monasticism and its intervention in traditional family structures, the place of women and gender in Buddhism, the relationship between religious ideals and everyday life, the question of self-reliance versus divine assistance, and the power of images and icons. Our readings of primary sources offer close engagement with Buddhist ideas and practices, allowing us to understand how the religion shaped the ways people in pre-modern Asia saw and interacted with their worlds.

Students will read various forms of literature and policy documents to assess the extent to which Marxist theory is central to the interpretation of religion in Communist China. Primary sources will include Chinese constitutional articles, white papers, and editorials in English translation. Secondary sources will cover a wide range of interpretations and perspectives on the position of religious institutions and religious practices in the PRC. The first part of this course will investigate the expression of religiosity under Communism in China; the rehabilitation of Confucian values; the constitutional protection of religion and religious belief in China; the relationship between ethnicity and religious policies; the Sinicization of religion; and the administration of the five officially accepted religious traditions in the People's Republic of China (Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Daoism, and Islam). The second part of the course will focus on the recent cases related to the Muslim Uyghurs of Xinjiang and the Tibetan Buddhists of Western China. The class will explore some of the most controversial issues related to these two ethnic minorities including terrorism, religious violence, nationalism, assimilation, foreign influence, and soft power. The course format will consist of both lectures and discussions, during which students will be encouraged to exercise critical thinking and lead in-class presentations.

    "ClassOverview": "Are our actions free or fated? What larger forces shape the choices we make? To what do we owe our successes, and what is to blame for our mistakes? In East Asian religions, such questions have been answered with reference to a variety of different concepts of fate, fortune, and karma. These concepts shape not only how people have viewed the world, but also how they have made their way through life. This class focuses on religious approaches to questions of destiny in premodern East Asia. We begin by studying Indian Buddhist ideas of karma and early Chinese notions of fate and fortune preceding Buddhism's arrival in China, then turn to the ways people in China and Japan negotiated these various concepts over the many centuries following the arrival of Buddhism. In the end, we discover important throughlines amid the diversity of religious responses to the problem of destiny in East Asian history.",

The course will be structured in two parts: in the first part students will be encouraged to build expertise in the basic concepts, definitions, and general academic consensus (as well as debates) about categories including religion, violence, sacrifice, ritual, martyrdom, and also nationalism, politics, and terrorism through reading both primary sources (in English translation) and secondary sources (scholarly writings). We will then move into an analysis of case studies that focus on specific circumstances where Buddhist rhetoric, scriptural authority, and religious practices have played a role in violence including suicide, terrorist-related actions, and self-immolation predominantly in pre- and modern Asia.Some of the provocative questions that this course asks include: Why and how is religion involved in politics? Is Buddhism a pacifist religion? How does religion rationalize violence? How can some Buddhist leaders embrace terror as a political tool? Are the recent practices of self-immolation in Tibet acts of violence? Can non-violence be violent?",

By using the Atlantic Ocean as a framing device, we will consider the relationship of modern Judaism to histories of race, slavery, and colonialism. We will consider how different ways of thinking about race can help us reimagine Jewish history, Judaism as a religion, and Jewishness as a form of collective identity. In turn, we'll explore how Jewish culture can widen the lens on interactions between race and religion. How have Jews shaped and been shaped by racial concepts and ideology derived from Europe and its overseas colonies? How have Jews negotiated the shifting politics of race in the light of gendered, class-based, and interreligious conflicts?Are Jews a race? Are Jews white? These are the commonly asked and deceptively brief questions that we will only begin to address, and only through some of the specific and varied contexts in which they are asked; in Europe, the United States, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and Africa.

Despite the splintering of Judaism into different denominations, Jews the world over are unified by their commitment to studying Talmud. The Talmud is an unusual work of literature, and it has been credited as an influence on codes of law, sermons, modern works of Jewish literature, and even Seinfeld. This course will explain the Talmud's import and durability within Jewish culture while introducing students to the rigors of legal analysis that lie at the heart of most talmudic passages. The course is ideal for those interested in religion, law, logic games and questions of textual interpretation.

Through a series of case studies, we will consider how religious practitioners and the spiritual but not religious are using digital media to challenge established religious authority, create community, innovate devotional practices, and theorize their experiences. We will examine, for example, collage and hip hop, virtual pujas, mindfulness apps, user-generated gods, emoji spells, tulpamancy, transhumanism, and Slender Man. Through these case studies we will explore how digital natives and adopters are reimagining religious presence, mediation, community, ethics, and ontology.

    "ClassOverview": "Throughout the history of the Jewish religion, times of crisis and collective suffering have given rise to theological innovation and creative shifts in religious expression as Jews sought to understand their tradition in light of their experiences. In the wake of the Holocaust, Jews and others faced a similar need for religious rethinking. In theological terms, they asked: where was God and should we expect God to act in human history? What does this event indicate about God's existence? In human terms, they asked: how do we live as Jews today? How do we live as human beings? Given that the Holocaust occurred in modern Europe and within the context of the Second World War, not only Jews but Christians and others asked many of these same questions and also struggled to articulate answers. Focusing on theological and literary texts, in this course we will explore how Jews and others have reshaped their thinking about God and religion in response to the Holocaust and the experience of suffering in the modern world.",

It is organized around a set of legal cases and supporting materials curated by Professor Hurd and Professor Winnifred Sullivan which are available through the open access Teaching Law and Religion Case Study Archive. Rather than taking the US as the paragon of religious freedom and considering whether the rest of the world lives up to US standards, the course approaches the United States as one among many societies living amidst religious diversity. We study these dynamics comparatively, examining the ways in which religious, legal, and political traditions intersect, interact and co-constitute. A second objective is to connect these cases to local (Northwestern, Evanston, Chicago, Illinois, and US) communities and concerns, focusing on religion, race, and indigeneity. This contributes to an effort to strengthen Northwestern's Center for Native American and Indigenous Research and realize the objectives of the Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion by including substantial course content on African American, Native American, and Jewish American political/religious history and experience.The course traverses disciplinary, geographic, and secular-religious boundaries, drawing on readings from politics, socio-legal studies, religious studies, indigenous studies, anthropology, history, and popular culture. Students will consider their own experiences of living with religious diversity as we explore strategies to think religion anew in the contemporary world. The teaching modules used in this course were developed under the auspices of two research projects supported by the Henry R. Luce Initiative on Religion and International Affairs and the course itself with the support of a Provost's Faculty Grant for Innovation in Diversity and Equity.",

    "ClassOverview": "In recent years, gender and sexuality have become hot topics in Eastern Europe. In 2013, for example, gender was Poland's word of the year with the country's leading bishops claiming that Gender ideology' [is] worse than Nazism and Communism. In the same year, Russian leaders passed the so-called gay propaganda law stifling Russians' access to LGBTQ+ affirming education and support services. What informs this hostility toward issues of gender and sexuality in the Slavic world? How and why have sexual minorities become targets of political attacks? And how have attitudes toward gender and sexuality changed over time? This course answers these questions by tracing the history and culture of sexuality in Eastern Europe from the 19th century to the present. We will cover such topics as fin de si cle culture and sexual decadence; the medicalization of sexuality; prostitution and sex-trafficking; sex reform and sexology; the World Wars and sexuality; gender and sexuality under state socialism, and representations of queerness in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. As a First-Year Seminar, this course will help students further develop critical thinking and writing skills and familiarize them with research methods necessary for writing college-level papers.",

How did the backwards Russia of the early twentieth century become the most advanced nation in the world in gender and family legislation by the 1920's? What happened as the Soviet government attempted to translate Marxist theories of the family into social practice?  What happened when revolutionary visions were replaced by the Utopia in Power of Joseph Stalin? What becomes of utopian dreams in first a post-utopian and then a post-Soviet reality?  How did the state regulate gender representation in the arts?  And how did literature and the arts shape, resist or reflect key transformations in Soviet society as the century progressed?  We will examine both state-sanctioned and oppositional works, including poetry, short stories, novellas, novels, literary journalism, film, and the visual arts as we explore these questions.All readings in English.

    "ClassOverview": "This discussion-based seminar is an introduction to the social scientific and historical study of U.S. citizenship. Debates over immigration and citizenship are long-standing in the United States. And today's politicians continue to raise concerns over who (as in what kind of people) should be granted membership. These are fundamentally questions over who belongs and who is deserving. Some on the right, including the 45th President, seek to abolish birthright citizenship, claiming it is a magnet for illegal immigration.Students will learn the history behind granting citizenship to anyone born in the United States. They explore the history of U.S. citizenship law and learn about the interests and justifications for narrower and more capacious definitions of citizenship. Other than birthright citizenship, what regimes for granting citizenship exist? What are the exceptions to birthright citizenship in the United States? How are decisions about and definitions of rights and membership related to ideas of race? Overall, this course will address how the United States has drawn boundaries of membership in racial terms and explore what this means for envisioning future possibilities.",

Often these social processes go unobserved or unacknowledged, and sociologists treat it as their job to shed analytical light on how people experience and participate in society. Through sociological analysis, we can answer questions like: How did Evanston become largely segregated by race? Why is it illegal for people to sell their kidneys? Is suicide contagious? Why would someone pay for Instagram followers?Sociology is a huge field of study, and includes and enormous variety of topics and methods. Each week, we will focus on a specific area of sociological study (Culture, Gender, Race, Family, Money, Deviance, etc.) with the goal of offering you a general overview of the types of questions sociologists ask and how they answer them. By the end of the quarter, you will be able to think sociologically about your own world, and hopefully develop a budding interest in one or more of the areas we discuss in class.",

    "ClassOverview": "In this course, we will investigate how social conditions come to be defined as social problems. This course will be divided into two sections. The first section will be an overview of how sociologists have approached the study of social problems including theoretical perspectives (symbolic interactionist, conflict, structural-functionalist and constructionist perspectives). In this section, we will also conceptually examine the roles of policymakers, social advocates, and the media in the process of defining social problems. In the second section of the course, we will use the perspectives and conceptual tools from the first part to analyze contemporary social problems including the effects of the media and social media on children and teenagers. As a class, we will also examine the debates surrounding several social problem case studies to understand how interested parties can define a similar situation as problematic, but do so for very diverse reasons and in doing so suggest very different solutions.",

In fact, one of sociology's most enduring findings is that certain social problems including crime are highly concentrated within cities. The central question this course seeks to answer is: Why do some neighborhoods have higher rates of crime than others? In addressing this question, the course covers a wide range of theories, paying particular attention to ecological, social structural, and cultural aspects of city-life. In addition to covering the main sociological theories in these areas, the course will also focus on several in-depth topics including: street gangs, the underground economy, immigration, and mass incarceration.",

We'll work to understand how these institutions emerge and address existing societal problems, ultimately analyzing the potential of different institutional configurations to encourage or discourage desired outcomes. We focus on both coordination-type dilemmas (e.g. how to parent, which side of the street to drive on, who provides health care) and collective-action dilemmas (e.g. how to police fishermen going over quota, funding of public radio). We end with a study of how institutions persist--possibly beyond their useful lifespan--such as the persistence of the intentionally inefficient 'QWERTY' keyboard, and a conversation about why it's difficult to enact policy change. The course has two overarching goals. This first is to develop a new way of approaching and analyzing social institutions. The second is to build skills in critical analysis though case studies and applications with a local Evanston institution.",

By the end of the course students will be able to sharply interrogate how social and political conditions shape the production of claims about the genetic basis of illness and difference. While much of the scholarship we will consider is broadly sociological, some of it is drawn from other fields, and part of the goal of the course is to show what is gained when we think about health, disability, and illness from an interdisciplinary perspective.

These collectives which we refer to as social movements are fundamentally communicative in nature. Movements are formed through communication and it is through communication that they achieve much of their strategic objectives. Moreover, movements are inextricably linked to communications channels. As media and communication technologies have transformed, so too have the structures and the practices of social movements. This course explores the complex relationships between communication and social movements, bringing together theories from communication studies, sociology, and political science, as well as tracing historically how social movements have developed new practices of achieving social change.",

    "ClassOverview": "This class explores historical and contemporary perspectives on the evolving interrelationship between politics, society, and inequality in the United States. It is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview or broad survey of the general topic. Rather, it offers a curated look at a selection of important themes, topics, and questions. Are the sources and structures of inequality in the United States cross-nationally distinctive? In what ways does it make sense to say that broad patterns of social and political conflict over economic distribution have shifted historically in response to underlying transformations of the American economy? To the extent that the fruits of American prosperity were more equally distributed among white Americans after the Second World War, compared to any period before or since, what has led to the alarmingly high level of economic inequality and political polarization that is plainly evident in our time? Why has Black protest against racial inequality since the late-1960s (not coincidentally the moment in time when the federal government laid the policy foundations of mass incarceration) largely taken the form of urban rebellion? What do ordinary Americans today think about economic inequality, and why have American elites nevertheless been able to continue amassing ever greater amounts of power and wealth? Among the assigned readings are Piketty's Capital and Ideology, Levy's Ages of American Capitalism, Prasad's Land of Too Much, Hacker and Pierson's American Amnesia, Phillips-Fein's Fear City, Hinton's America on Fire, Kruse and Zelizer's Fault Lines, McCall's The Undeserving Rich, and Wessel's Only the Rich Can Play. (Please note that the list of assigned readings may change before the start of the quarter.) Strong pedagogical emphasis will be placed on learning how to read books closely and critically. In addition to giving presentations on selected books, students will write two book reviews. There are no long writing or research assignments.",

    "ClassOverview": "On the Research University: Its Past, Future and PresentThe recent proposal to eliminate virtually all humanities majors from the University of Wisconsin- Stevens Point (March 2018), one of many such proposals in the last few years, will serve us as an entryway into understanding not just the public university and the humanities, but the modern research university, both public and private, and the mission of the undergraduate liberal arts and graduate education within it. How did the university reach its current manifestation and where does it go from here? Beginning with an overview of its origins in the German Enlightenment, the seminar will then shift to focus on the development of existing departments and programs at the end of the nineteenth century and the disciplinary knowledge which they house nowadays. We will be especially interested in the rise of the research university in the United States after 1945 and its decline some forty years later. We will seek to understand undergraduate liberal arts education and graduate education within the pedagogical and administrative frameworks in which they function. What is their relationship to job markets, and how do different institutions position their students in relation to those markets? We will also study the university's various members and constituencies, such as students, faculty, and administrators, and their roles. Within this context, we will explore challenges facing the modern research university, including the impact of neoliberal policies and mounting student debt, public vs. private institutions, the decline of academic freedom, the high cost of postsecondary education, the growth of contingent labor, the downsizing of tenure-track faculty, the corporatization of university administration, technical training vs. liberal arts curricula, and the introduction of consumer culture into the higher education, among others.",

We explore comparatively both the connections to the Latin American and European literary traditions that saw his figure emerged and also to the many debates that his literature helped define: What constitutes a literary text? What is an author/authority? How to write/read literature in the age of the mass media? How does literary translation inform cultural translation? What cultural traditions can the Latin American writers claim as their own? Starting with his 1920s poetry Fervor de Buenos Aires and his relation to Martin Fierro avant-garde group, we move into the core of his Fictions stories, El Aleph, El Sur, The Library of Babel,  to finally discuss programmatic essays, such as The Argentine Writer and Tradition.  The bibliography on Borges is vast and rich, so we accompany our reading of Borges' fiction with secondary readings that focus on providing a historical, cultural and specifically literary context.",

This seems an odd question to ask about a predominantly Catholic Latin American country--even though its small Jewish population is the largest in Latin America and the third largest in the Americas overall. Yet this seemingly homogeneous nation is more multi-ethnic and multi-cultural than you might suppose. Indeed, the story of the Jewish presence in Argentina is a surprising, and yet surprisingly familiar, story. Our approach to that story will be through literature, film, and critical essays. Primary: Los gauchos judos (1910), a narrative about a Jewish agricultural colony in the early 20th c., by Alberto Gerchunoff, the founding father of Jewish-Argentine literature; short stories and essays (1930s-40s) by Jorge Luis Borges (though not Jewish, he has been called a Jewish writer); Preso sin nombre, celda sin namero (1981), a testimonial narrative by Jacobo Timerman about his imprisonment during Argentina's military dictatorship; El libro de los recuerdos (1994), a comically reflective novel about a modern Buenos Aires Jewish family, by Ana Mara Shua; and Derecho de familia (2006), the third film in Daniel Burman's semi-autobiographical trilogy about contemporary Jewish life in Buenos Aires.

    "ClassOverview": "Indigeneities in Latin AmericaThis course explores the notion of indigeneity and its attendant manifestations and representations in literary and cultural production in Latin America. First, we will consider some definitions of the term, ranging from the implicit in colonial-era texts, to the explicit in 19th and 20th century narratival and essayistic production. Secondly, we will dive into the large, diverse scholarship much of it contemporary and ranging in origin from social sciences such as anthropology and archaeology to humanities such as history and literary studies that has attempted to articulate indigeneity in connection to the demands of, alternately, nationalisms, vindicatory movements, social revolution, identitarian politics, and other political and cultural formations in the continent. Key amongst our considerations will be understanding not simply the shapes that indigeneity takes within these disciplinary, cultural and political contexts, but also the mechanisms that allow it to move between them. We will seek to account for, then, the generation of indigeneity from lettered and cultural objects and their historical moments. Readings will be selected from a range of primary and secondary texts and may include Guaman Poma de Ayala, El Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Popol Vuh, el Manuscrito de Huarochir, Manuel Gamio, Jos Carlos Mari tegui, Fausto Reinaga, Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, Jos Mara Arguedas, Gamaliel Churata, Alison Spedding, Blanca Wiethcchter, C sar Calvo, Rigoberta Mencha, Marisol de la Cadena, Joanne Rappaport, Tom Cummins, el Taller de Historia Oral Andina, and others.",

We pay special attention to how avant-garde artists and writers negotiated foreign influence and local conditions; and how these movements conceived themselves as profoundly local while speaking in an international idiom. We will also contrast the historical avant-garde period of 1920s with its resurgence in the 1960s and the politics of counter-culture movements.

While many data science problems will require knowledge of multiple coding languages and technologies, this course chooses to utilize R through the IDE RStudio to conduct data science. Students will develop skills, tools, and strategies for modeling and understanding complex data. Methods to be addressed include linear regression and classification, model selection, and model assessment, generalized additive models, resampling methods, and regularization methods. These skills will be developed through project/lab based learning (1-2 projects/labs per week). The skills developed in this course are necessary for STAT 301-3 Data Science 3 with R.",

The data augmentation methods rely on an augmentation of the data which simplifies the likelihood or posterior density. These include: EM, Data Augmentation, Poor Man's Data Augmentation and the Gibbs sampler. All methods are motivated and illustrated with real examples.",
