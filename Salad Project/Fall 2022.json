This course is an introduction to classical music from the 18th century to the present day, and it will endeavor to answer questions such as these.The class is structured as a series of units, each focusing on the work of a single composer and developing frameworks, both musical and historical, for appreciating it. The primary goal of this course is to help students become conversant with a broad repertoire of music. As such, the bulk of the work involves listening attentively to the pieces discussed in each class session; readings and response posts will be assigned with the goal of guiding this listening. Assessments will include two listening exams and a final presentation. This course is open to all students; no prior musical training is required.",

    "ClassOverview": "Today's successful musician must embody entrepreneurship in career-making alongside the artistry of music-making. Students who enroll in this course will learn about various career models in music and the performing arts. Besides covering basic knowledge about conventional career paths, this course will facilitate and encourage students to imagine how they might innovate such conventions, taking advantage of the fast-changing environment of professional musicians in today's dynamic culture. Specific practical skills relevant to performing-arts careers will be complemented by open-ended exploration of what it means \u2013 and could mean \u2013 to be a performing artist. In the final analysis, the course will prepare students to begin work on building a career with the same discipline and creativity they apply every day to their musicianship.This course is a hybrid seminar-practicum. Class discussions will drive thinking about unconventional performing-arts careers while team-based work on projects will develop practical skills necessary for launching an innovative arts venture. In the process, students will gain an understanding of how the performing-arts field operates so that you can take professional advantage of a variety of opportunities and create opportunities for yourself and others. Guest speakers representing various career types and innovations will also familiarize students with basic know-how to offer current models of effective change.Along the way, the course will cover skills and topics that affect all performing-arts related careers, drawn from business-related fields including: fee and contract negotiation; artist and booking management; fundraising and grant-writing; communication, marketing and public relations; social media; organizational and business structures; intellectual property rights; business model generation; arts advocacy; diversity, equity and inclusion; and community engagement.",

This course will introduce students upon methods sound studies, ethnomusicology, affect theory, queer studies, urban studies, and the critical geography of race. In addition to reading and regular writing assignments, students will engage in ethnographic work in Chicago throughout the quarter.Chicago will be our main field site, however we will take a comparative approach and bring in other cities in the global south and north as points of reference. Topics may include the Chicago House scene, drag culture, the South Side's configuration a racialized and eroticized space, the development of noise codes to constrain queer domestic life, the role of music as erotic force in the clubs of Boystown, musical performances in bath houses, and the opera house as a site of gay male desire and community. All of these spaces offer ways to think of the importance of sound and music in the production of queer affect and urban sociability.",

Students will acquire a basic understanding of medieval music notation, learn to navigate music manuscripts, learn about cultures in the Middle Ages, comment on issues of performance practice, and consider how concepts in musical aesthetics can also be located in the other arts and in society. I would like to inspire students to discover the beauty, richness, and intellectual appeal of medieval music, a music repertoire unfamiliar to most, yet tremendously rewarding and foundational to later practices. I would also like students to gain a wider historical framework in which to place \"common practice era\" music, contemporary music, and folk music, and question what is meant by \"Western\" music altogether, using musics of the Middle Ages and their revival as a lens.Students from outside the music department are welcome in the course and encouraged to meet with the instructor in the first weeks of the quarter to review music rudiments, if necessary.",

We will especially consider the social uses of music at a time of increasing musical literacy and the rise of a mass-market music industry as well as the place of the art in such institutions as home, church, and royal court.  Our focus includes musical styles and genres from the \"golden age\" of sacred choral music, the madrigal and other secular part-songs, and the rise of idiomatic instrumental music, especially for strings and keyboards. We will also look how the religious strife and related displacement of people that marked the sixteenth century influenced music, its circulation, and its performance, and especially what it meant for a highly visible musician and entrepreneur to belong to a persecuted minority while also serving his nation-state. In-class performance is encouraged, especially since a great deal of the music was created for amateur domestic recreation.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course focuses on ideas of \"authenticity\" in music from the mid-twentieth century to the present, principally through performance practices of historical art-music (especially from the eighteenth century) and local popular music traditions (particularly rural American or \"country\" music). We will think about meanings of \"authenticity\" in music against a background of twentieth- and twenty-first century cultural and philosophical considerations of the idea, as scholars, auditors, performers, and consumers of music and music-related products. We will also think about the tensions between historical and cultural musical customs and current performance practices, as well as ways in which popular films use music to suggest various kinds of authenticities, the nostalgic, and the familiar.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course, created to coincide with world-wide celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the death of William Byrd, provides an introduction to music and musical life in sixteenth-century Europe by contextualizing it around his life and legacy. We will especially consider the social uses of music at a time of increasing musical literacy and the rise of a mass-market music industry as well as the place of the art in such institutions as home, church, and royal court.  Our focus includes musical styles and genres from the \"golden age\" of sacred choral music, the madrigal and other secular part-songs, and the rise of idiomatic instrumental music, especially for strings and keyboards. We will also look how the religious strife and related displacement of people that marked the sixteenth century influenced music, its circulation, and its performance, and especially what it meant for a highly visible musician and entrepreneur to belong to a persecuted minority while also serving his nation-state. In-class performance is encouraged, especially since a great deal of the music was created for amateur domestic recreation.",

This course offers an introduction to music composition, through an exploration of techniques, notational styles, aesthetic theories, and more. Students of any background are welcome. We will practice a variety of methods for writing original music, including notational approaches using musical staves, text, images, and sound; students will engage these approaches through reading, listening, and short composition assignments that will be realized and discussed in class. The final project will involve expanding one or more earlier assignments into a larger piece.Prior knowledge of composition or music theory is not required. However, students will be required to perform or otherwise realize their composition assignments in class, so proficiency on a musical instrument or DAW is encouraged. Students should come to class with an open mind, ready to share their work and offer constructive feedback for their peers.",

We will explore such themes as polarization, political image-making and advertising, voting rights and voter suppression, as well as campaign rhetoric and policy issues. We will explore the 2022 campaign and consider the reckoning faced by Republicans and Democrats alike, as President Biden presses his agenda, Donald Trump argues his case from the wings, and both parties look ahead.

And now the rise of right-wing populists in Europe, a newly activist Russia, an influence-seeking China, and fallout from the presidency of Donald Trump. This course uses an engaging set of case studies and materials to chart one of the most intriguing stretches of international engagement in U.S. history. We will work collaboratively to understand why decisions were made, how policies were implemented and sold, and what it all may mean in the end. Assessing sources from presidential speeches and critics' rejoinders to film documentaries and media accounts, we will study goals and motivations, ends and means. As the course progresses, we will pay particular attention to the foreign policy choices of the U.S. president and the domestic debate about those choices.This is not a class where you are expected to produce journalism, and no prior experience with journalism or Medill is required.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course introduces you to Native American environmental issues, such as treaty-based hunting, fishing, and gathering rights; air and water quality issues; mining; land-to-trust issues; and sacred sites with a particular emphasis on the First Nations in the Great Lakes region. In addition, it will also provide connections to corresponding international Indigenous environmental issues, and the responses and debates across science research, news and international policy contexts.The seminar focuses on how the media cover Native American environmental issues and how that coverage contributes to the formation of public opinion and public policy. The seminar provides the critical tools to analyze current environmental struggles; to understand the controversies within a cultural context; and to make informed decisions about issues that affect us all. The central case study of the seminar will be water and fishing rights for Indigenous Peoples, and how they are part of larger land rights issues.Over the past two decades the issue of tribal sovereignty has become front-page news. From major confrontations over pipelines affecting Tribal Reservations mobilizing Indigenous people and their allies around the world, to battles over whaling rights and mining of tar sands, to sulfide mining adjacent to Tribal Reservations, to disputed land claims in the Northeast and battles in the West over water, fracking, and grazing,  the rights of Native governments to exercise their sovereignty remains in the new century at the cultural, political, and legal core of American contemporary history.These and many more issues\u2014air and water quality standards, treaty rights, and land-into-trust\u2014have contributed to tension between Native and non-Native communities, and have become the subject of news reports, in both mainstream and tribal media. The goals of this seminar are to understand how tribal sovereignty and treaty rights inform contemporary environmental issues; to identify source selection, bias, and framing in mainstream and tribal media accounts; to analyze and critique mainstream and tribal media accounts for accuracy and bias; and finally gain intercultural knowledge and competence through a final project that explores the intersection of Native environmental issues and the media.",

Further complicating the reporting environment is the rising hostility toward the media, partly the result of deliberate attempts to undermine journalistic credibility, which has led officials and the public to increasingly turn to the courts to attack journalists and suppress information. This course will review the laws, legal cases and ethical standards essential to being a journalist in the 21st Century -- not only for what you report and publish, but also for what you post on social media -- including defamation, privacy, information access, protecting confidential sources, and copyright.",

Historically and contemporarily, the course will look at how actual viruses and infectious diseases (such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Hepatitis C, influenza and SARS-CoV-2) have been covered in the global press. We will consider how certain groups of humans have been depicted as viruses themselves, such as how Jewish/disabled/queer/Roma people were described by the German and US press circa WW II; how African Americans were described in the US press circa Jim Crow; and how Muslim, Mexican and migrant people are described in press and social media now.

The course will examine the intersection of sports and social/political agendas, the #MeToo movement, awareness of brain damage risk, use of public funding for stadiums and the way media coverage can advance or derail these conversations.",

It's designed to provide an overview of the domain for graduate students who aim to report on, write for, edit in, or curate for magazines broadly defined (print, online, or both). The course is intended as a magazine-inflected complement to the other major course of the term -- reporting and revising in your project-based learning class during the first quarter.Our work together is primarily based on reading, viewing, and analysis of major magazine titles - legacy as well as newcomers - to explore the fundamental qualities of strong narratives. No matter what role you envision for yourself in media, our work will be relevant. Is it your ambition to create new knowledge through writing journalistic pieces for existing outlets? Or to edit, curate, produce, or otherwise serve as a team leader on investigative projects? Or to become an entrepreneur launching something brand new?This is the place to consider the heart of the matter - the power of diverse story forms for different purposes - and to deepen your understanding of them as you prepare yourself for a year-long exploration of your own talents. Every person involved in the creation of meaningful journalism, after all, should be literate in key elements of compelling journalism.The course is designed, in particular, for students who will move in the next three quarters of study to magazine presentation, digital media, magazine editing, and feature writing. For students who intend to finish up in the Narrative Capstone, here's the first step on that pathway.Each week we'll sink deeply into the editorial architecture of a particular magazine outlet. We'll regularly hear directly from writers and editors, in person and via Zoom or Skype. We'll build towards a broad view of what's currently happening in the domain, helping each student clarify where s/he would like to put her effort during the year.The overarching idea is to reveal varied approaches to immersion reporting, story framing, and sustained narrative.",

And the consent of the governed regarding public policy and policymakers is informed by a free and responsible press. But what happens when this process is distorted by a disinformation campaign set in motion by government elites who attempt to engineer public consent? What is the role of the news media in reporting the news, assessing it, critiquing it, contextualizing it in contributing to enlightened public decision making?  How might the conventions of journalism\u2014the traditional rules and practices that guide our work\u2014be used against the objectives of journalism? Through assigned readings and robust discussion, this seminar will explore the dynamics of public opinion and attempts to manipulate it. Against the backdrop of media coverage of current events, we will come to understand the framework for propaganda, its elements, how it works and how it has been used in the construction and reinforcement of social difference. Ultimately, we will see how this process has been weaponized\u2014pitting identifiable groups against each other\u2014in the process of assuming and maintaining political power. In this process, we will see how the term \"fake news\" has been used in an effort to undermine media credibility and cause public confusion about what to believe.  Ironically, and unsurprisingly, we will see that the very people charging \"fake news\" are the ones generating it. In the end, we must consider our role as journalists in this process.  How have we been complicit?  What is our responsibility to ensure a deeper public appreciation of the value of social difference? What is the public responsibility in achieving a degree of literacy, particularly with increasing reliance on social media? These are vital questions as we find ourselves on the cusp of a new demographic reality, a new democratic reality, a truly plural society.",

A lawsuit accusing the Chicago City Council of violating open meeting laws is filed after reporters learn of private discussions on the city's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A journalist covering a protest over the death of George Floyd files a federal lawsuit accusing police of violating his First and Fourth Amendment rights for spraying him with a chemical agent. As these and other cases demonstrate, journalists in these contentious times need to turn to the law to confront increasing challenges to newsgathering and investigative reporting. This unique joint Practicum with Northwestern's Pritzker School of Law - comprised of externships and weekly seminars - aims to advance the public's access to information, to hold institutions accountable, and to defend free speech and press freedom.  Through externships of 10-12 hours a week at media organizations, non-profits, and press-advocacy groups (provided and matched by faculty), Medill students will learn how to research and prepare access requests and how to research legal or policy matters related to investigative and accountability issues. Through lectures and guest speakers, students will be introduced to the major transparency laws and other topics inherent in the relevant casework.  Working collaboratively with law students, Medill students will deepen their understanding of the subject matters, share their experiences on outside projects, and discuss the legal and ethical issues that arise.

    "ClassOverview": "This course provides students with an introduction to African filmmaking.  Although Africa has been represented on screen essentially since the birth of cinema, it is only within the last 60 years that it has had a cinema of its own in which African filmmakers made their own films. In the early 20th - century colonial powers used cinema as ethnography and propaganda to represent Africa as savage, dark, mysterious, and dangerous to legitimize their oppressive regimes. Hollywood also misrepresented Africans in popular films such as the Tarzan series (1918 - 2016) and King Solomon's Mines (1937).  While this course acknowledges this pre-history, it is ultimately interested in the period beginning in the 1960's when most African nations gained independence.  We will tackle a variety of filmic forms, aesthetic, and ideologies employed by African filmmakers from the independence era until today including (but not limited to) social realism, anti-colonialism, short films, animation, avant-gardism, and science fiction. We will also examine the social and political issues that many African films address including gender politics, racism, Eurocentrism, migration, corruption, human rights, and Westernization while also acknowledging that we need not saddle African cinema with a burden of representing Africa any more than we do for any other cinema. In other words, African cinema is also entertainment. Moreover, we will discuss how films are circulated, funded, distributed, and consumed - including the role of piracy. Primarily, the course focuses on sub-Saharan black African cinema but does include some North African films to gesture to the enormity of the geography covered by African Film Studies.",

For 350 years, Britain and India shared a common history that has a lasting legacy today.  This course explores the major themes of the British Empire in India from the formation of the East India Company in 1600 to Indian Independence and Partition in 1947. Empires are shaped by the encounters between agents of imperial power and indigenous peoples. These encounters change both groups creating a hybrid society with long term consequences. We will explore the different types of imperial encounters that took place between Britons and Indians from conquest and subjugation to negotiation and collaboration, and finally struggle and resistance. By focusing on these experiences are goal is to avoid the traditional imperial narrative of superior Britons and inferior Indians and instead understand British India as a place of encounters and experiences.",

In addition to exploring what performance is, the course also explores what performance does. Through a combination of written assignments and staged performance projects, students engage in embodied and collaborative learning. We further take up performance as concept, analytic, and method to understand the social world, paying particular attention to Global South contexts.

    "ClassOverview": "At Northwestern, we ask students to take liberal arts courses. There is an inherent belief that these courses lead us to better know the world around us. In this Ways of Knowing course, we will unpack the notion of a liberal education and its quintessential space, the university. We will critically examine the very idea of knowledge: What makes the knowledge you acquire here valuable? Which kinds of knowledge are considered to be significant and authoritative in the societies we live in, and why? How is this knowledge produced, for what purposes, and with what social effects? What are the entanglements between knowledge and power? Who has the authority to produce it, who do we count as an authoritative knower on an issue, and why? What makes this knowledge valuable to you and how does it serve the goals you came to pursue? The goal of this class is to encourage and enable you to critically reflect on the conditions of your learning and the purposes for which you are pursuing it. More specifically, you will learn about colonial knowledge production and its manifestations in the contemporary world. Thus, we will look at education in our postcolonial context, where there is nothing really post about colonialism. We will examine how dominant forms of knowledge production have been and continue to be shaped and influenced by colonialism. To do this, we will explore the history of colonial knowledge production, specifically focusing on the idea of the human as a primary way of understanding our world. Throughout the semester, we will explore topics of education, power, knowledge production, colonialism and humanity through the lens of philosophy, anthropology, history and literature, but also thinking of these various modes of knowledge production as intersecting with and informing each other. Our goal is to get you to think critically about different ways of understanding the world. We also want you to think about how we have gotten to where we are, as well as to equip you with tools for critiquing the world around you, especially your own university - your second home for the next two years.",

We will investigate girls' media artifacts as aesthetic, political, and commercial texts through which youth have interfaced with lessons about gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, national identity, and generation at different historical moments. Although American commercial media will be taken up as our main object of study, students will have opportunities to explore media made outside the U.S. in their own research projects, and we will consider girls' independent production and reception practices in both Western and non-Western contexts.

    "ClassOverview": "Sound design is crucial to the success of visual storytelling and interaction design. While often subtle, skillfully produced sound design immerses the viewer, listener, or product end-user, shaping the emotional landscape of the piece and guiding the audience along. It's an observable phenomenon that people can watch and even enjoy a scratchy, jumpy, low-quality image, (e.g. The Blair Witch Project (1999)), but they cannot bear poorly produced audio. Therefore, artfully crafted sound design is a vital component of effective audio-visual media. This course explores the history of sound design, its theoretical underpinnings, and the core features of a compelling soundscape. We will explore the workflow of a professionally produced soundtrack\u2014including capturing, editing, repairing, mixing, and applying effects. Students will breakdown and analyze soundscapes by listening to examples from different periods and media formats, produced via a variety of methods, (both analog and digital). Students will examine the state of the art and potential futures of sound design, discussing the core concepts of immersive and 3D audio. Finally, students will apply the knowledge and skills developed in the class to produce original sound design projects to strengthen their portfolios, win awards, and attract real-world clients.",

Public Diplomacy has been long regarded as an important tool in building and managing relationships; it influences thoughts and actions in the international arena via three major components: the government, the media, and public opinion. The media have played an integral role shaping and influencing images of countries through news or entertainment programming. With the advent of globalization and new communication technologies, the field has seen further changes, most significantly the increasing significance of the use of social media in global politics and social movements. Some of the particular themes explored in this course are: (1) social media and digital diplomacy; (2) the difference between propaganda and soft power; (3) international broadcasting; (4) culture and exchange diplomacy. By the end of the course, students will be able to: (1) identify how public diplomacy and the media interact; (2) recognize major concepts related to public/digital diplomacy and public opinion; (3) analyze the evolving role of state and non-state actor's practices of soft power.",

Why are some stories timeless? How do some stories have global appeal? Joseph Campbell coined the term \"monomyth\" to describe a single journey universally travelled in an epic pursuit of heroism, arguing that there are fundamental story elements that engages every person's psychological and metaphysical needs. This course takes a fresh look at those elements with a special focus on the inner drives of the hero's and heroine's journeys, understanding that the former is a journey through the first half of life while the latter is a journey through the second. With a critical review of archetypal theories, the monomyth can be distilled of its androcentric underpinnings and expanded for greater inclusion and understanding. The course will review the theory of character transformation in the stages of the two heroic journeys and evaluated against psychological development in Jungian terms and metaphysical growth in Sufi expressions. The journeys are then discussed in terms of film and literature, and further examined against scriptural stories and spiritual experiences.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course addresses the issue of refugees and displacement and their impacts in the Arab world, situated within interdisciplinary debates on forced migration debates and an understanding of the international refugee regime. With a focus on Palestinian and Syrian refugee movements (and other displaced groups in the Arab region such as Iraq, Somalia, Yemen), the course adopts a holistic approach to the study of refugees. It is grounded largely on peopled perspectives and drawing upon sociological, ethnographic, and historical material. Less focused on causes of refugee movements, we will look into the meanings of displacement through refugees' experiences, how they adapt to their new situations and find ways to overcome challenges, how local and international organizations and communities respond to refugee influxes in short-term and protracted situations, how different media and formats represent refugees and issues, and the ways forward and policy opportunities. I will invite a few guest speakers to speak about key issues across the semester and bridge our learning in current events and debates. Students will be exposed to the work of anthropologists, sociologists, historians, journalists, aid workers, policy makers, literary authors/artists, and voices of refugees themselves. This insight will equip future communicators and journalists with knowledge of issues and formats to engage in meaningful work around refugees.",

In addition to discussion of the assigned texts and screenings, students will be expected to generate their own responses to crisis within both forms, for example by writing a short screenplay or film synopsis, and by crafting an op-ed that navigates the conventions of media outlets.",

They are usually concerned with rectifying an existing social \"wrong\"\u2014something unjust, oppressive, discriminatory, or exclusionary\u2014by directly mobilizing people through non-traditional political and judicial routes. In many cases, social movements involve \"demands\" that aim to capture public attention and pressure governmental action.",

    "ClassOverview": "The expression \"direct action\" was frequently deployed by Martin Luther King during the US Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. In MLK's political imagination (which owes much to Gandhi), direct action refers to a mode of political mobilization, a \"movement\"-based mobilization and stagings of \"the people\" that function as an alternative to a parliamentary/electoral mode of acquiring power/influence over the state and its policies. Direct action is also regarded as an alternative to the legal route for redressing grievances when the court delays and denies social justice. MLK, like Gandhi, links or equates direct action with the non-violent modes of mobilization and stagings of the people.In this seminar, we will explore a different and alternative genealogy (not necessarily violent) of direct action in terms of crowds, riots, and uprisings which are molecular and local rather than molar and national in terms of scope, temporality, and addressivity.  This course will enable the students to rethink direct action\u2014in all its ubiquity\u2014in the context of our age, an era characterized by rapid growth, selective affluence, and abundance, all amidst deepening inequality across the globe. This seminar will involve extensive readings of \"theoretical\" texts as well as an in-depth exploration of case studies.",

It offers students various points of entry into the field as well as tools for critically examining dance history, theory, and practice. Approaching dance through film, scholarly texts, and creative practice, we will interrogate how the dancing body is central to cultural history. We will learn to analyze dance through movement analysis and theoretical frameworks with a particular attention to race, gender, sexuality, and nation. As we examine dance across different sociohistorical and cultural contexts, we will ask how dance canons are made and deconstructed. This course equips students to understand dance as an integral part of cultural formation.",

The material will pull from a range of contemporary modern techniques including Counter Technique, European floor work and release styles, Flying Low, and Bartenieff Fundamentals. All of which include, spiraling, inverting, effortless traveling, and the overall practice of less effort for efficient functional movement.Each class will begin with a guided follow-along structure, to stretch, ground into the floor, and warm our bodies. The remainder of the class will be spent refining these ideas through short or long phrases. We will spend at least a week to two weeks on each of these phrases to allow the body time to fully integrate and somatically comprehend the spatial pathways. As a facilitator, I am invested in cultivating a space of open conversation about somatic sensory experiences, as well as a space of experimenting with pathways that are effective to your unique anatomy. Cultivating a space that is creative, holistic, and looking to enjoy our bodies moving through space.",

    "ClassOverview": "Jump Rhythm focuses on using the syncopated rhythms of jazz music as well as of funk and rap music to generate high-energy, sharp-edged rhythmic movement in both the body and the voice.In Jump Rhythm, we accompany all our movement with either jazz-based scat-singing or  percussive singing of the lyrics of existing musical-theatre songs. This rhythm-driven use of the voice defines Jump Rhythm as an acting-based, music-based, rhythmic-movement class. It is not in any way a traditionally defined ballet-based dance class built upon alignment regimens like turn-out, standing up straight, and/or core-strength.   At bottom, it's a class for performing arts people  who love to move to the pulse of beat-driven music.Thus, the emphasis in this class is on what we feel on the inside of our bodies, not on how we look on the outside of our bodies; on using the primal, instinctually human movements of the body to express the physical-emotional energy within us, not on re-shaping the parts of our body to conform to a socially constructed ideal of \"elegance\" without us.A Jump Rhythm mantra:  \"Don't Get It Right, Just Get It Out.\"Working toward these goals, we embrace the concept of full-bodied rhythm-making.  Full-bodied rhythm-making focuses on using what we call the \"5 primary drumbeaters\" of the body - the 2 eyes, the 2 hands, and rhythm-singing voice - to strike rhythms against the \"drumheads\" of the space. These include the imaginary drumheads surrounding the body; body parts like our hips or thighs that our hands beat against as they would against a conga drum or beatbox; or that universal drumhead loved by all tap and step dancers, the floor. In this way, Jump Rhythm can also be described as tap dancing through the whole body.The class is not only about expressing sharp-edged percussive movement through body and voice.  It also involves exploring how relaxation can be used in alternation with such hard-hitting movement without straining or injuring the body.  We do this - moving vigorously without excess tension and without pain - by working with a gravity-directed, injury-preventive alignment concept called Standing Down Straight\u00ae.",

Designed to deepen the potential for expression in the moving body, this class unites function and expression using weight, space, time and intention. Infusing personal and technical movement with urgency, vitality and humanity, we will explore inner and outer focus to bridge improvised and re-membered movement. A somatic focus will bring increased personal agency and clarity in choice-making. Fundamental movement patterns, balletic principles, and release techniques will be combined, explored and purposed toward the potential for joy in expression.",

The material will pull from a range of contemporary modern techniques including Counter Technique, European floor work and release styles, Flying Low, and Bartenieff Fundamentals. All of which include, spiraling, inverting, effortless traveling, and the overall practice of less effort for efficient functional movement.Each class will begin with a guided follow-along structure, to stretch, ground into the floor, and warm our bodies. Occasionally we will do this through improvisation sessions and/or across the floor phrasing. This concentrated time at the beginning of class will develop our somatic awareness of our body in space and wake up the various pathways in the body. The remainder of the class will be spent refining these ideas through short or long movement phrases. We will spend at least a week to two weeks on each of these phrases to allow the body time to fully integrate and somatically comprehend the spatial pathways. As a facilitator, I am invested in cultivating a space of open conversation about somatic sensory experiences, as well as a space of experimenting with pathways that are effective to your unique anatomy. Cultivating a space that is creative, holistic, and connective.",

You will also learn the design process, which emphasizes collaboration and rapid iteration - expressing and testing ideas with an audience in a virtuous cycle. You will develop this understanding through weekly presentations, studio critique, and in-class and out of class assignments. No previous experience is required.

    "ClassOverview": "Networks play an increasingly important role in our understanding of human behavior. In communication and the organizational sciences, extraordinary developments in computing and telecommunications have engendered new organizational forms based on fluid, dynamic networks. These new network forms of self-organization are constantly evolving in dynamic communities as new network links are created and dysfunctional ones dissolved. While many writers assert that the capability to nurture networks will differentiate dominant 21st century organizations, little is known about how this important organizational form emerges and evolves.This seminar is intended to review theoretical, conceptual, and analytic issues associated with network perspectives on communicating and organizing. The course will review scholarship on the science of networks in communication, computer science, economics, engineering, organizational science, life sciences, physical sciences, political science, psychology, and sociology in order to take an in-depth look at theories, methods, and tools to examine the structure and dynamics of networks.Most class time will be spent discussing the assigned readings. Laboratory exercises will provide experience with network analysis, modeling and visualization tools. A term paper is expected advancing some theoretical, methodological, or computational aspect of network science.PrerequisitesThe course has no formal pre-requisites but will be most beneficial to students who have had an introductory statistics course covering descriptive statistics for central tendencies and dispersion, correlation, sampling, and significance testing.Software toolsThe course will utilize R packages for all laboratory assignments. However, some of the following software tools will be introduced throughout the course",

Students will read theory and case studies on such topics as how queer users shape social media to how race influences cable TV distribution. The course is organized into three key areas of inquiry -- culture, organization, and technology -- with the goal of understanding the complex ways they interrelate.This class is rooted in Black feminism and queer of color critique but engages a range of theoretical frameworks.

Course participants will acquire the conceptual, technical, and practical skills to conduct independent statistical analyses and become more sophisticated consumers of quantitative research in communication, HCI, and adjacent disciplines. The course will probably cover techniques such as: hypothesis testing, t-tests, chi-squared tests, ANOVA, linear regression; and logistic regression using the R programming language for all examples and assignments. We will also consider salient issues in quantitative empirical research such as reproducibility and the statistical crisis in science. We may cover other topics as time and interest allow.",

As Silvio Waisbord has argued, communication is a \"post-discipline,\" held together more so by a set of academic institutions, professional societies, and publication venues than by any coherent canon of theories or set of standard methodologies. Yet you are here to receive training in this so-called field, under the presumption that you will become experts in \"communication.\" This graduate seminar provides an overview of theories that are widely considered foundational to various subdisciplines under the umbrella of communication studies. The goal here is not to exhaust the set of \"core\" theories, but to provide a starting point for investigation into a few of the most common areas of study. Additionally, the seminar aims to train students in the process of producing social theory regarding media and communication.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"New wave\" is a ubiquitous but notoriously imprecise term that has been applied to various trends in cinema that emerged around the world beginning in the mid-1950s. As an historical term it is used to delineate shared styles, themes, and techniques that define certain national and international film movements. As a kind of descriptive shorthand, it has been applied more broadly to movements that abandoned conventional narrative techniques in favor of experimentation with the cinematic medium, while also confronting social and political problems specific to the context of production. Thus, the inaugural French New Wave has lent its title to film trends in Britain, Iran, Japan, Hong Kong, and many other locations around the world. This course offers a critical and historical introduction to one of these latter-day new waves, the \"New Taiwan Cinema,\" which emerged in the early 1980s as a reaction against contemporaneous commercial cinema. Through a careful investigation of the work of the three most important representatives of this \"new\" cinema\u2014Hou Hsiao-hsien \u4faf\u5b5d\u8ce2, Tsai Ming-Liang \u8521\u660e\u4eae, and Edward Yang \u694a\u5fb7\u660c\u2014this course will consider not only the experimental form and social consciousness of the Taiwanese New Wave but also the specific economic, social, and institutional structures\u2014national and transnational\u2014that shaped it. We will also study critical and theoretical writings on this cinema to better understand both the Taiwanese cultural milieu that produced it, and the broader global film culture of which it has become such an important part. Whenever possible, we will place individual Taiwanese films in dialogue with the Asian and European film cultures that influenced them as well as the films and filmmakers that they have influenced. There are no prerequisites for this class and no previous knowledge of Chinese or Taiwanese literature, culture, language, or history is assumed.",

From a director/producer standpoint, we will address creating and communicating a vision to casting and actors. From an actor standpoint, we will investigate how to prepare copy for auditions, including identifying the \"world of the play\" (genre, tone, and style), the collaboration between actor and director in working with copy, and the journey from first audition to booking.

Students will explore the juxtaposition of performance art and media in the making of their own performative/media-based works that will draw on the punk, DIY traditions of queer artmaking that emphasizes process-based techniques and available, cheap, materials. Simultaneously throughout the quarter, students will learn to talk about, critique, and defend their work, and the work of their peers through active participation in weekly class discussions and traditional studio-style critiques. Examples of artists and writers explored in this class include Mark Aguhar, Nao Bustamante, Tourmaline, Annie Sprinkle, Vaginal Cr\u00e8me Davis, Keijuan Thomas, Xandra Ibarra, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, Roy P\u00e9rez, and Joshua Chambers-Letson.For this class, students will be expected to create new and conceptually rich performance-based work in response to concepts covered in class and the student's own research and developing practice. The class will be comprised of open class discussions on the assigned readings/viewings, in-class explorations in solo and group performance work, and formal studio critiques in which students will present, and defend, their own work to their peers, instructors, or invited guests. While minor parameters will be given to students by the instructor for explorations, students are expected to be exceptionally self-driven and directed to create work that is ready to present and critique for class during studio critiques. The class will culminate in a \"screening\" style event of the student's own design in which they will perform/show their final, most advanced and developed piece of the quarter for a public audience (tbd in what capacity with Covid restrictions).",

Every decision inediting, to go from continuity to discontinuity and back, is the very essence of the cinematic artform. What our goals become are determined by those decisions and the film that is cultivatedthrough those choices. In this course, students will be introduced to the fundamentals ofnon-linear video editing and guided through readings and video essays on the discourse of theartform. Over the quarter, students will spend a majority of their time endeavoring hands-onpractice with non-linear editing software through in-class workshops, weekly video editingexercises, and 3 major editing projects that are to be completed outside of class.

There are days I wish I didn't have to teach these lessons, but as an Indigenous womxn silence is deadening.\" These scenes of liberation and care about underrepresented communities who live in precarity appear in film and media culture as radical acts of resistance against erasure.When visualized through film and media, the liberation and care imperative shift according to contextual histories and experiences with injustices. Guided by these principles, filmmakers, artists, and communities have used moving images across cinematic history to create radical aesthetics, narrate and document oppressive struggles, and screen moving images that unsettle the conventional uses of film and media to imagine many liberated worlds.In primarily centering understudied film manifestos written by historically underrepresented groups, this course engages with theories and histories of liberation and care written from what we might call a subaltern positionality. The course will substantially focus on themes such as the formation of kinships and communities; mobilization under historical traumas; anticolonial and decolonial engagements with the camera; feminist and queer futures; and environmental protection as the ultimate radical act of liberation and care.How do definitions of care and liberation shift across cinematic space and time? How is film and media central to interpretations of liberation and care as a result of racial, sexual, gender, and class difference? What questions, debates, issues, and potentialities emerge when we think about the camera as a tool for visioning liberation and care?",

Students will undertake several exercises in video editing with the goal of developing an audiovisual analysis of a media text of their choosing. The seminar will serve as an introduction to basic video editing skills, and no previous experience is required. As part of our immersion in the videographic method in media studies we will watch and discuss many examples of video essays, listen to interviews with scholars working in this form, and survey the outlets for and critical discussion of the videographic essay as a means of scholarly publication. The course situates the emergence of videographic criticism in the broader history of textual analysis as a method of media studies. The close analysis of texts is a basic foundation of media studies, whether as the starting point for a research project, an investigation of media aesthetics, or a source of evidence to ground an argument. We will thus be asking the question, \"what was textual analysis in media studies,\" considering ideas about texts and textuality via approaches such as cine-semiotics and Bakhtinian dialogism, in the process considering the relation of text to social and historical context. At the same time, we will ask, \"what is textual analysis in media studies now, or what could it be?\"",

The class will take a formalist approach to relating style to meaning production, but additional critical issues regarding representation, cultural inflection/bias, ethics, et al, will be considered for a broad understanding of the complex intersection of form, content, directorial intention and audience reception.",

Given the evolving nature of documentary filmmaking, and our program's emphasis on hybridity and formal exploration, this course will investigate the way cinematography functions across a range of styles and modes in and outside the category of nonfiction filmmaking. This course aims to move students toward a more holistic approach to film production, meaning that ideas are conceived and realized through a consideration of all aspects of the filmmaking process, including cinematography, lighting, sound, and postproduction. This approach to filmmaking has enormous benefits even if you intend to remain in a directorial role, as it allows you to speak the language of other specialists and think expansively about the ways a given idea can be expressed.",

Throughout the quarter, selects and string-outs will be reviewed by the instructor and receive peer-to-peer feedback, with the goal of having edited selects or a solid first assembly ready by the end of the fall quarter. Interactive projects should have a fully developed prototype plan by the end of the quarter. Students will also be introduced to relevant production and post-production topics, view and discuss film examples, and write an artist statement. Each student will also research and develop a short presentation that critically analyzes a specific film or a filmmaker's body of work that has relevance for the student's own thesis project.",

    "ClassOverview": "As techniques for sonic expression have grown more sophisticated - from installation art to narrative podcasts and video games - the questions that we bring to bear on sound and its place in our lives and histories have also begun to evolve. This course aims to give sound professionals a grounding in that conversation by immersing them in Sound Studies, a new and inspiring field that occupies an intersection between the arts, social sciences and humanities.Sound Studies helps us to understand how music works through the popular media, interprets and unpacks great soundtracks and albums, uncovers the history of the sound technologies that we use, asks how hearing changes over time and across cultures, looks at the politics behind forms of vocal expression and mixing, and calls attention to sonic dimensions of environments. In recent years, Sound Studies has also been taking the form of sound and provides raw ideas for podcasts, films and other sound works. Indeed, it was scholar Murray Schafer who coined the term \"soundscape,\" a concept that is now not only used by a whole field of artists, but also by acousticians, game developers and urban planners.Each week we begin by considering significant works of sonic expression, using them as a framework to understand key questions in Sound Studies today. Though much of our emphasis will be on sound in popular forms of media, we will also consider various forms of sound technology, sound art, and sound performance. Students will be introduced to a range of sound-based industries and learn how they work together. Key works of sound art and design will demonstrate the aesthetics of sound, for example: the expressive ways in which sounds are combined with images in media culture; and how mediated sounds facilitate new encounters with the lived environment. Students will gain an understanding of how sound mediates identity and provides a medium for cultural expression.",

We will investigate what role theatrical performances play in the tourism industry but also analyze other touristic activities such as guided tours and museum exhibitions as performance, and understand how culture is staged for the tourism industry. We will engage examples from around the globe such as US-living history museums, tourism of Indigenous and Native America, simulated Mexico-US border crossings, ancient ruins in Rome, so-called \"\"cultural villages\"\" in South Africa, dark tourism in Cambodia, and tourism as political theater in North Korea. Through these examples, we will explore questions like: What does the analysis of tourism as performance reveal about a conception of a 'cultural other'? How does performance enable the exploration of one's (cultural) roots in tourism? What are ethical considerations that should be taken into account by the tourism industry? Our research will unveil tourism's political and ideological implications and facilitate a critical understanding of tourism as cultural production.Please be aware that some examples feature graphic descriptions and images of violence and racism as well as glorification and spectacularizations of imperialism.",

We will read plays that take Chicago as their subject, theme, and/or locale and explore how perceptions of the city and its people have been used, developed, and shaped by these plays during the 20th and 21st centuries. As Chicago has inspired many works, it will also provide a wonderful opportunity to examine plays by such writers as Lorraine Hansberry (A Raisin in the Sun), August Wilson (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom), and Maurine Watkins (Chicago), among many others. Students will be expected to complete cultural document worksheets, participate in discussion, collaborate on a midterm project, and create a final paper/presentation.",

    "ClassOverview": "Comedy has always been engrained within culture, but often its significant impact and power have been minimized. There is a bias, certainly in American popular culture, against comedy, as can be seen in how few comic movies ever get nominated or win Academy Awards. However, comedy both set trends within society and is reflective of how people understand their world, so this course will take a serious look at the interrelation between comedy and American culture. Topics will include: philosophical theories of why we laugh, historical beginnings of prominent comic forms such as sitcoms and political humor, and comic innovations found in stand-up and sketch. There will also be opportunities to perform in class as a means of further deepening our understanding of comedy through lived experience. Through this class, we hope to gain a better understanding of comedy's influence in our culture and in our individual lives - plus, I hope we will laugh a lot.",

    "ClassOverview": "--Standing Down Straight\u00ae for Actors (SDS) is a method of body-and-voice training that teaches students of acting to vocalize and move with full energy without causing strain or injury to themselves.  The source of this holistic approach to working is gravity-directed relaxation.  SDS explains how the human body is designed to work with not against gravity; how using gravity teaches us to fully embrace the reality of the body in all its visceral dimensions.--By using gravity's cost-free and always-available support, we explore how to perform any stage action with relaxation, power, and, mostly, efficiency.  Efficiency = using the least amount of effort to complete a task.  Or, in short, efficiency = using less to achieve more.--In SDS, we practice working efficiently by learning gravity-directed lying, sitting, standing, and vocal exercises that we then apply to our monologues and partnered scenes.  The exercises guide us to 1) exhale and let go of unneeded physical and emotional tensions; 2) ground the body by sensing where the force of gravity \"wants\" the bones of our body to go (down!); 3) fuse the movement of our eyes, hands, and voice into a single action that helps us do any stage action with energy and without strain.--Why do we focus on partnering the eyes, hands, and voice?  Because these small but mighty articulators of physical and emotional energy are our chief means of expressing our innermost convictions -- in life as well as in performance. Playwright Sarah Ruhl coined a phrase that sums up how these five ever-present body parts support us doing the work of SDS:  \"smallness in the service of bigness.\"",

Students will explore the juxtaposition of performance art and media in the making of their own performative/media-based works that will draw on the punk, DIY traditions of queer artmaking that emphasizes process-based techniques and available, cheap, materials. Simultaneously throughout the quarter, students will learn to talk about, critique, and defend their work, and the work of their peers through active participation in weekly class discussions and traditional studio-style critiques. Examples of artists and writers explored in this class include Mark Aguhar, Nao Bustamante, Tourmaline, Annie Sprinkle, Vaginal Cr\u2000me Davis, Keijuan Thomas, Xandra Ibarra, Jos\u2000 Mu\u2000oz, Roy P\u2000rez, and Joshua Chambers-Letson.For this class, students will be expected to create new and conceptually rich performance-based work in response to concepts covered in class and the student's own research and developing practice. The class will be comprised of open class discussions on the assigned readings/viewings, in-class explorations in solo and group performance work, and formal studio critiques in which students will present, and defend, their own work to their peers, instructors, or invited guests. While minor parameters will be given to students by the instructor for explorations, students are expected to be exceptionally self-driven and directed to create work that is ready to present and critique for class during studio critiques. The class will culminate in a \"screening\" style event of the student's own design in which they will perform/show their final, most advanced and developed piece of the quarter for a public audience (tbd in what capacity with Covid restrictions).",

Developing a robust understanding of how to identify and deconstruct the dynamic and varying role that identities play in organizations is key to understanding how/why organizations behave, whose needs they serve/who is left out or marginalized, and the possibility of/conditions for change.

At the same time, there is complexity in such collective and social action, and organizational life is often marked by a number of recurring and difficult problems. The purpose of this course is to help students understand the complexities of organizations.  It is designed to provide an exposure to theories of organization, important organizational issues and processes, and a variety of strategies and tactics useful to successful organizational leaders and followers alike.",

For most of us, our initial encounter with the world is in an organization - a hospital, and then most of us spend the bulk of our childhood and adolescences in another organization - a family. We spend much of our childhood and adolescence also attending yet another organization - the school. Most Americans still work in an organization as distinct from being self-employed. Organizations are a fixture in our lives at an early age and continue to play a central role across the lifespan. The ubiquity of organizations is such that we often take them for granted, rarely stopping to consider how they influence our lives. Organizational change has garnered considerable attention from academics, private consultants and policy-makers. This interest cuts across organizational sectors \u2014 for-profit, non-profit, and government organizations. This class focuses on organizational change. Studies in Organizational Change is an advanced course in the Learning & Organizational Change major designed to introduce students to key constructs and ideas about change in organizations. The class is organized as follows: We will begin with a discussion of the notion of change in general and organizational change in particular. We will identify different levels of analysis that scholars who study organizational change focus on. We will then examine different levers or resources for organizational change including - leadership, routines, human capital, social capital, technology, culture, identity and organizational environments. Throughout the class, students will be expected to constantly apply the constructs and ideas to particular cases of organizational change.",

For example, access to fresh food is often limited in some urban areas, as is access to health care.  Understanding and redressing these issues therefore often requires the use of maps and mapping technologies.  In this course, we will explore the use of spatial analysis to address problems and opportunities of diversity and inclusion.  Students will learn to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to create maps to understand and analyze these issues, and to suggest solutions.  Gaining familiarity with GIS therefore will be one of the major outcomes of the course.

Using primarily seminar-style discussion and a series of case studies, this course focuses on building and analyzing theoretical frameworks to understand the nature of individual, group, and organizational identity, identity politics, theories of intersectionality (that is, the critical interactions/tensions among social roles, histories, identities, social locations, and so on), and how each of these function and manifest in the life of and life in myriad types of organizations and groups.  Developing a robust understanding of how to identify and deconstruct the dynamic and varying role that identities play in organizations and group life is key to understanding the \"life course\" and experiences of individuals within groups, how/why organizations behave the way they do, whose needs groups/organizations serve/who is left out or marginalized, and the possibility of/conditions for change at both the individual and group levels.",

It is the assumption of this course that we will be in a better position to achieve these goals if we can somehow characterize the knowledge that individuals possess at any given time, and how this knowledge changes as they learn. In short, this is a course about individual cognition and learning.However, there are important respects in which the aims of this course differ from a cognition course outside of the Learning Sciences. In LS, we are less concerned with general mechanisms that underlie cognition across domains, and more concerned with issues of knowledge and learning that are specific to individual subject-matter domains. We want to understand, for example, what is challenging about coming to understand Darwin's theory of natural selection. We are also interested in phenomena of learning on a very particular timescale (weeks to months) and knowledge-scale (systems of knowledge).A key goal of this course is for you to develop an LS-style sensibility for seeing and understanding learning. Thus, a major focus of this course will be to practice observing and analyzing learning phenomena.",

What counts as fact vs. opinion vs. belief and so on; who gets to decide and under what conditions? How is knowledge produced and how does it gain traction?  How does the source and type of knowledge interact with socio-political-cultural constructs and systems of power and, in turn, how can \"knowledge\" be used to produce and/or perpetuate power and privilege or to empower those who are marginalized? Finally, how does what we do in SESP and at Northwestern as both consumers and producers of knowledge fit within the landscape of these questions?In this course students will explore these and other questions to gain insight into the social production, distribution, consumption, interpretation, and operationalization of \"knowledge.\" Using primarily seminar-style discussion, the first portion of the course focuses on building and analyzing theoretical frameworks and applied texts in order to generate a working understanding of \"knowledge\" in its myriad forms.  Among our goals for the first portion of the course is to tie theoretical,  academic, and \"folk\" knowledges to everyday experiences and the world around us writ large.  The second portion of the class will involve a series of applied of cases studies, including welcoming members of the SESP faculty community to present on their research, which we will work to bring into conversation with our generated frameworks regarding the sources, types, and implications of knowledge.",

First, how do children develop the knowledge, skills, and personality characteristics that allow them to become successful adults? Second, how do differences among children come about?In this course, you will learn about children's biological, cognitive, social, and emotional development as well as their social environment, including family, peers, school, ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The course will cover normative development (what are the typical changes that occur for children) and individual differences (how do children differ from one another and why). At the end of this course, you will be able to evaluate research claims we hear every day (i.e., in academia, educational settings, popular media, casual conversation, etc.), and critically differentiate between myths and facts regarding child and adolescent development.",

A practice that fosters learning and agency to imagine the collective action needed to build sustainable and equitable worlds. This experimental course will employ a hands-on approach to \"liberatory design\" and \"critical world making\" to transcend boundaries and reimagine alternative futures. Together, we will foster a critical consciousness of what community-based design affords and disaffords. Over the course of the quarter, we will engage in reflective art exercises, design interventions, and a final community showcase. The course is an invitation to explore your identity as a designer and educator, positioning yourself in a design ecosystem. Practicing a studio culture, we will explore the relational aspects of historical narratives and speculative design while dreaming of what could be.Core questions include:Who gets to design? What privileges are associated with doing design? What would it mean to decolonize design?How do we shift the relationship between those who hold the privilege to design and those impacted by it disproportionately?What are the ethical and sociopolitical implications associated with the use of technologies in community interactions?How do our identities, lived experiences, personal histories and positional power impact design outcomes?How do we cultivate collective consciousness to dream and transform educational possibilities that are embodied in love, care, and humanizing pedagogies?",

This seminar addresses individual memory, including survivor and witness testimony, memory and trauma, and the impact of the Holocaust on survivors' families and communities. We also explore collective Holocaust memory and the development of mainstream framings of Holocaust history. We consider Jewish, Roma, and other victim narratives, including national memorialization, rituals of commemoration, and the development of Holocaust memorials, museums, and institutions in the United States and around the world. And we study how we have come to remember the Nazi perpetrators and their collaborators. We draw on course texts, including film and fiction, to ask questions about the relationships between individual and collective memories, as well as between commemoration and education.",

    "ClassOverview": "Social policy is integral to the fabric of society. It helps to determine who has access to resources and services, regulates how those are obtained, and is constantly negotiated by changing ideas about public need and the common good. A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation.The first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents.",

I am surged upon and overswept, but through it all, I remain myself.\" A first-year seminar gives students the tools to manage the \"surge\" of college, both socioemotionally and academically. All of you have left the familiarity of your families, neighborhoods, and high schools to enter a new context, one with new forms of diversity, hierarchy, division, and opportunity for connections. Even though she was in college and writing nearly 100 years ago, Hurston is still an awesome guide as you navigate issues of race, gender, class, and academic belonging at Northwestern. Some topics we will explore include: privilege, politics, love, friendship, curiosity, perseverance, grades, work, and community. Hurston's vast body of work will be the basis for your own analysis, reflections and writing.",

Popular discourse has either depicted black trans people as glamorous superstars or always and already predisposed to death. This course, then, seeks to usefully complicate these narratives and focus on black and trans life. To that end, the course will task students with gaining an understanding of the nuances of black life via its entanglement with the afterlife of slavery and contemporary radicalism; with trans life via its troubling of the gender binary; and black trans life via the ways that blackness and transness interact and converge. This is, in short, a course on black life, full stop; trans life, full stop; and black trans life, full stop.",

In this course, students will interrogate what, when, where, and how blackness\u2014as phenotype, culture, and analytic\u2014is known. Students will encounter black feminist approaches to blackness, nihilistic and pessimistic understandings of blackness, philosophically capacious meditations on blackness, and literary depictions of blackness. In short, this course will complicate the very meaning of blackness and generate, beautifully, more questions rather than answers.",

    "ClassOverview": "Between 2015 and 2020 the political movement Black Lives Matter emerged in the US and in different parts of the world, concerned with the mobilizations against police violence towards Black populations and oppositions to structural white supremacy. In 2020 the scale and spread of the Black Lives Matter movement was such that the New York Times referred to it as the largest social movement in US history. Certainly, there had been nothing like it since the anti-colonial movements and civil rights movements of the late 1950s and mid-1960s or the Black power movement of the 1970s, all of which had reverberations and replications among different Black populations across the world (e.g. Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean). This course seeks to introduce students to the political and cultural ideas underpinning the historical issues and social questions raised by the Black Lives Matter movement and asks why these are repeatedly part of Black social life. In particular, it examines different meanings of Black resistance and Black political identities as part of what Cedric Robinson famously referred to as the Black Radical Tradition. The course will discuss various Black political ideas ranging from Black Marxism and Black Feminism to Afropessimism and Afrofuturism.",

    "ClassOverview": "Africa invokes myriad images in the global imagination. It figures in debates about the rise of capitalism and the attendant global inequity that sustains it. Africa actively shapes global youth culture at the same time as it gets conjured as a counterpoint to Eurocentric ideas of progress. Whether as a geographic location, an idea, as \"backward\" or as the site of vibrant and dynamic contemporary cultures, the continent has continued to foment lively debate among intellectuals, political pundits, policy makers, global citizens, and among Africans themselves. This course introduces students to the social, cultural, political, and economic diversity of the continent as well as approach Africa from a broad range of disciplinary perspectives such as history, performance, economics, and cultural studies, among others. We will interrogate how the idea of \"Africa\" gets mobilized in popular discourse in the United States and beyond. We will also ask: How does Africa as we know it emerge from monumental events in contemporary history? How might we understand Africa's current circumstances considering histories of colonialism and imperialism while also appreciating the continent's centrality in the workings of the contemporary world? What role do artists and artistic practices play in shaping encounters with Africa?",

Students will explore the cosmological features and embodied expressions that characterize these traditions.

    "ClassOverview": "This course will explore through reading, viewing, listening and discussion the relation between the study of affect and the study of Blackness. Affect refers to the realm of emotional and bodily intensities that emerge as feelings and orientations in personal, social, political and cultural relationships. The importance of understanding affect lies in drawing our attention to modes in which individuals and groups are motivated and mobilized in registers of social being that do not rely on cognitive processing and rational argument but are rather anchored in non-discursive passionate attachments, embodied practices . In relation to the idea of Affect the course will discuss the meaning of Black Feeling in both abjection/social death and eventfulness/social life, in the affective formation of identity, practice, sensibility, comportment and community. In developing this approach, the specific focus of Black Affect will be the political and cultural orientations of feeling, sensation, communication, and intelligibility in different expressions and forms of Black Music and/or Black Film.",

    "ClassOverview": "In \"Echoes of the Jazz Age,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that \"it was an age of miracles, it was an age of art, it was an age of excess, and it was an age of satire. \" During the cultural crisis of Modernism, when a variety of intellectual revolutions and the unprecedented carnage of the Great War suggested that Western civilization was either a sham or doomed, writers and other artists created new literary forms. Their aesthetic innovation often depicted art and love (or sex) as parallel (or contradictory) ways to create meaning the wasteland of Modernity. In this class, we will read and discuss canonical, lesser-known, and popular texts of \u201820s in order to explore how these revolutionary writers saw love and art in their own time and, maybe, in the future.",

Integral to this process are the methods they use to collect and analyze data, as well as the ways in which scientists work together as a community to interpret evidence and draw conclusions. In this class, we will take a multidisciplinary approach to examining biological thought and action and their social ramifications. We will seek to understand science as a social pursuit: the work of human beings with individual, disciplinary, and cultural differences, and requiring tremendous investments in training and equipment. Does it matter that participation in science is more accessible to some than to others? How do biases, assumptions, uncertainty, and error manifest in scientific work? What is the history of scientific values such as objectivity and reproducibility? The course will conclude by investigating current topics of public debate",

    "ClassOverview": "How do cultural anthropologists write about people and places? How can we understand community building at Northwestern University after pandemic turned the world upside-down and transformed many social practices? To find out, you will study and practice cultural anthropology's most famous method of research and writing, ethnography. Along with weekly readings, student-run roundtable discussions will pair NU campus groups with Evanston organizations for discussion focusing on intersecting social and economic power structures such as race, gender, sexuality, and economic inequality. Discussions and readings will inform your ethnographic observation of campus and local communities you choose to observe throughout the quarter, building toward a final creative/academic project presentation on one aspect of college life. Conducting your participant-observation research will empower you to 1. make sense of your environment in the current moment, 2. turn an analytical eye toward Northwestern as an institution, and 3. critically develop your new role as a college student. Requirements include participation in class discussion and roundtables, field observation and taking fieldnotes, one short article presentation, and your final project presentation. Course materials are one text for purchase ($30 new) as well as book chapters, articles, and films/visuals accessible free online.",

We will learn how to frame archaeological questions in terms of intellectual merit (the potential to advance knowledge) and broader impacts (the potential to benefit society).  The main goal of the course is to design an archaeological research project.  We will achieve this goal across the quarter through writing a proposal to conduct an archaeological research project designed by the student.  We will review successful proposals by archaeologists to decipher how researchers link theory, data, methods, and analysis in their archaeological research design and use these as templates for our own project designs. Upon completion of the course students should be comfortable with designing archaeological research and writing research proposals to get funding for their project, important skills to know whether you plan to continue in archaeology and academia, or not.________________________________________",

    "ClassOverview": "This class is an introduction to Political Ecology, a multidisciplinary body of theory and research that analyzes the environmental articulations of political, economic, and social difference and inequality. The key concepts, debates, and approaches in this field address two main questions: (1) How do humans' interactions with the environment shape power and politics? (2) How do power and politics shape humans' interactions with the environment? These questions are critical to understanding and addressing the current issues of climate change, the Anthropocene, and environmental justice. Topics discussed in this class will include environmental scarcity and degradation, sustainability and conservation, and environmental justice. Readings will come from the disciplines of geography, anthropology and archaeology. Case studies will range from the historical to the present-day. No prior background in the environmental sciences is needed to appreciate and engage in this course.",

    "ClassOverview": "Particularly after the 9/11 attacks and during the war on terror that has ensued shortly thereafter, Muslim on the move\u2014ranging from international students, pilgrims as well as scientists and artists\u2014have continued to face increasingly scrutiny and surveillance in both global travel economies and national immigration regimes. These regimes gained even more important under the rule of authoritarian leaders in power across the globe from the US to India. What often unites Modi's India and Trump's United States is Islamophobia\u2014albeit in different guises\u2014as racialization of Islam and Muslims continues to punctuate our current era. What are the stakes of traveling while Muslim in that post 9/11 era of racing Islam? How do we come to understand such mobility? What assumptions underpin the attendant construction of Islam in such understandings, as various state and non-state actors enlist themselves to manage the movements of Muslims, specifically and exceptionally? In probing these questions, amongst others, in this seminar we aim to examine the interlocked relationship between Islam, mobility and security. We have three aims in front us: (1) becoming well-versed in studies of Islam and Islamophobia in the US and across the globe, (2) gaining a better understanding of Islam as a center tenet in a deeply uneven and racialized regime of \u2018global' mobility, and lastly, (3) critically analyzing global and local designs of security that underpin and manage those differential regimes of mobility.",

And we will imagine the implications of misinformation for the future and explore our agency in shaping that future. We will draw on case studies, documentaries, and anthropological and social scientific literature on rumor and gossip, conspiracy theories, post-truth politics, deradicalization, and social media to explore topics and concepts such as \"fake news,\" digital populism, algorithmic bias, weaponized disinformation, the \"infodemic,\" deep fakes, and more.

We will address two fundamental questions: Why is important to study the past?  What is the role of the past in the present?  Understanding our history and our heritage is crucial for the world today and key to understanding past ways of life.  The course frames archaeology within anthropology and the humanities and sciences more broadly and examines the role of anthropology, humanities, and science within the discipline of archaeology.  It addresses contemporary archaeological research and its promise for the future.Archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains.  A central focus of the course is on materiality as an archaeological method and a method that can be applied broadly within anthropology.  Archaeology is a team-based, participatory discipline, a methodology of practice that has important implications for how archaeologists can work in partnership with local communities and address contemporary issues.  Ethical, contemporary, and practice-based discussions will interweave across the course.  In this course students will develop an original research project that applies archaeological approaches to material culture in their own research.",

The first part of the course will rapidly outline the prehistory of the discipline and focus more extensively on the notion of evolution central to 19th century social theory. The second part of the course will deal with the individual contributions of three \"founding fathers\": Marx, Durkheim and Weber.

Translation has always been a crucial means of communication in spreading and preserving ideas and information. The Bible has been translated into more than five hundred languages and no matter what each of us believe, the impact on history and culture is undeniable.  Translation enables people all over the world speaking diverse languages to communicate and understand each other through their own cultural lens, hence building bridges between cultures and societies. Being able to translate with linguistic precision and cultural accuracy from one language to another is an important skill to cater to the high demand of professional translation necessary to the development of a global economy.  Translation is also important for personal enrichment and academic advancement.",

These assignments will usually involve writing (in various modes) as well as (sometimes) the presentation of that writing in class. As artists, we'll look at film, video, internet and installation works that engage with animation. Though we will be looking at some earlier films, contemporary works will be emphasized. Some of the films will also be available to stream through links, others will only be screened in class. And, although we will be taking a variety of approaches, the ability to analyze \u2014 perform a close reading \u2014 will be emphasized. A final essay of around 3,000 words \u2014 proposed in close consultation with the instructor \u2014 will allow the student to develop their own approach to a work or works of their choosing.",

To that end, students will experiment with narration and degrees of omniscience, objectivity and reliability. Readings and conversations on artists and writers who work with unreliable narration, diagramming, handwriting and the diaristic will also be a part of the course. There will be group discussions assessing smaller exercises and a group critique on one final, long-term project, an obsessive investigation.

When, in recent years, people cast critical attention on statues of Confederate generals, they participated in a long history of conflict over monuments. In this course we study general issues around monuments but focus specifically on monuments in Chicago: those that arguably represent historical violence and injustice; those that attempt to redress wrongs; those that do not yet exist but should. We also look at how contemporary artists have intervened in the very definition of what a monument is or can be, using different tactics (not necessarily always statues) to assert their claims. How can contemporary art represent history? How can we engage in debate about the ethical and political issues involved? By engaging with readings and multiple site visits, we will explore how to research, write about, discuss, and present the history, politics, and visual and material characteristics of works of art situated in public space. We will also explore the visual traces of African American, Native American, and women's history (and their intersections) in the city.",

How are these institutions enmeshed with broader cultural and political agendas regarding cultural identity and otherness, the formation of artistic canons, and even the concept of ancient art? This course explores modern strategies of collecting and display of material culture from ancient Egypt, the Middle East, Greece, and Rome, both in Europe and the United States and in their present-day homelands.The course approaches the construction of ancient Mediterranean, Egyptian, and Near Eastern art through modes of reception over the past two centuries. By analyzing programs of collecting and display, it seeks to understand both the development of modern scholarship in ancient art and the intersection of institutional and scholarly programs. Topics examined include the historical development of modern display practices in public and private museums; notions of authenticity and identity; issues of cultural heritage and patrimony; temporary and \"blockbuster\" shows; virtual exhibitions and museums; and the archaeological site as a locus of display. Chicago-area museums will provide important resources for studying firsthand examples of temporary and long-term installations.",

    "ClassOverview": "How did we get into this mess? The idea that human beings are separate from something called \"nature\" which they can and should dominate and control is one of the most pervasive ideas in modern Western culture\u2014meaning European and North American culture since the end of the Middle Ages. Over hundreds of years, alongside and intertwining with the development of capitalism and colonialism (for the \"indigenous\" was often placed on the side of nature), Western culture produced artificial divisions between human and nonhuman nature. Artists and scientists alike aspired to equal nature's powers and eventually exploit and \"conquer\" it\u2014or \"her,\" since \"Nature\" has often been gendered female\u2014with the tools of technology. How did this come about? How did nature push back? This course attempts an alternative, ecological history of Western art from the perspective of how art has depicted, defined, constructed, and reckoned with nature. What is nature and the natural? How do nature and art mutually define one another? What does it mean when art rejects nature? Without attempting to be comprehensive, the course will work through carefully selected case studies\u2014some of them student-generated\u2014in landscape, still life, and figure painting; scientific illustration; garden and landscape design; and photography. We will read accessible scholarship and primary texts in art theory and natural science. We will try (and undoubtedly not fully succeed) to come to terms with how this history is reflected in contemporary ecological and epidemiological crises. The course will be taught as a combination of lecture, discussion, and student presentations. It does not require prior knowledge but does hope for your attentive engagement and intellectual curiosity. Written work includes short papers, take-home midterm, and a an 8-10pp final paper.",

Using these on-site primary sources alongside critical essays and literary texts, we will attempt to answer a central question: why, during the 1960s and 1970s when the importance of documenting the realities of colonial rule and anti-colonial struggle was acknowledged as paramount, did artists and writers turn to various non-realist techniques (allegory, mysticism, visual poetry, metapoesis, eg) as formal strategies?

    "ClassOverview": "The historical juncture at which we currently find ourselves\u2014wracked by the compounding catastrophes of the global pandemic, ecological disaster, and postcolonial neoliberalism\u2014demands a radical rethinking of art history as an academic discipline. The urgency of redressing art history's lingering complicities with white supremacy, coloniality, and the profit motive propels us to reconsider foundational questions: What is art? What is history? What is an object? What is scholarship? What is a method? What is an archive? This seminar addresses these and other questions from perspectives both within and beyond art history, including Black Studies, Indigenous Studies, feminist and queer theory, postcolonial theory, new materialisms, among others. Rather than assimilating subaltern voices into a hegemonic \"global art history,\" the seminar begins with the premise that art history needs rebuilding from the ground up. The goal is to work proactively and collectively towards new horizons of art historical scholarship by attending to a diverse body of methodologies that offer dynamic ways of reconceptualizing art historical narration, (inter)disciplinarity, canonization, and research. While theory and historiography will be the abiding focus of the course, students will also be asked to bring in specific examples of art, architecture, and visual and material culture to ground our discussions in practices of object analysis.",

    "ClassOverview": "AY 22-23 \"New wave\" is a ubiquitous but imprecise term that has been applied to various trends in cinema that emerged around the world beginning in the mid-1950s. As an historical term it is used to delineate shared styles, themes, and techniques that define certain national and international film movements. As a kind of descriptive shorthand, it has been applied more broadly to movements that abandoned conventional narrative techniques in favor of experimentation with the cinematic medium, while also confronting social and political problems specific to the context of production. Thus, the inaugural French New Wave has lent its title to film trends in Britain, Iran, Japan, Hong Kong, and many other locations around the world. This course offers a critical and historical introduction to one of these latter-day new waves, the \"New Taiwan Cinema,\" which emerged in the early 1980s as a reaction against contemporaneous commercial cinema. Through a careful investigation of the work of the three most important representatives of this \"new\" cinema\u2014Hou Hsiao-hsien \u4faf\u5b5d\u8ce2, Tsai Ming-Liang \u8521\u660e\u4eae, and Edward Yang \u694a\u5fb7\u660c\u2014this course will consider not only the experimental form and social consciousness of the Taiwanese New Wave but also the specific economic, social, and institutional structures\u2014national and transnational\u2014that shaped it. We will also study critical and theoretical writings on this cinema to better understand both the Taiwanese cultural milieu that produced it, and the broader global film culture of which it has become such an important part. Whenever possible, we will place individual Taiwanese films in dialogue with the Asian and European film cultures that influenced them as well as the films and filmmakers that they have influenced.

    "ClassOverview": "AY 22 -23 This course will consider one of two fundamental mythological pillars of Indian society - the great Hindu epic, The Ramayana (Story of Rama). Thought to be composed almost three thousand years ago (give or take a few centuries), this epic tale has been re-told and re-imagined in changing social and cultural contexts ever since. This course is dedicated to understanding the nature of this ancient epic as a modern, \"living\" text in contemporary Indian society. After we develop, as a group, a basic understanding of the major events and characters of the Ramayana, we will explore it in modern contexts of literature, visual art, film, television, and political rhetoric. We will ask whether the resonance of the epic varies in each of these modern contexts, or if its \"meanings\" are as immortal as the tale itself. In light of several recent controversies resulting from both scholarly and aesthetic approaches to the Ramayana, we will also consider the difficulty of bridging the fraught divides between religion, literature, history, and art. Therefore this course will provide you with an introduction not only to the fascinating stories of the ancient epic literature itself, but also to major issues of religion, gender, popular culture, and social politics in contemporary India. By the end of the course you will be able to understand and explain how the modern and contemporary cultures of India are constructed, in part, through a constant re-evaluation of the Ramayana among other Hindu epic narratives.",

    "ClassOverview": "AY 22 - 23 THE BIG B: AMITABH BACHCHAN AND BOLLYWOOD STARDOMThe Hindi film industry, often called Bollywood, is famously one of the world's biggest and most recognizable. Every year, the studios in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) put out hundreds of movies, in addition to hundreds more that are released by India's other film industries in languages like Tamil, Telugu, and Bengali. Most of these movies are full of songs and dances, and bring action, comedy, tragedy, and romance together into one (often very complex) story. As the subject of our class has said, Hindi cinema \"offers poetic justice in three hours. You walk away with a smile on your lips and dried tears on your cheeks.\"Film industries everywhere choose a few actors to elevate above all others. The biggest of these movie stars in India, and perhaps in the world, is Amitabh Bachchan. With his brooding, rebellious charisma, not to mention his ready wit, resonant baritone voice, and enviable dance moves, his \"angry young man\" persona dominated the films of the 1970s. Today, half a century after his film debut, he is still a major star. His face and voice are instantly recognizable, not only throughout South Asia and its diaspora, but in Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere. As his characters have aged from youthful rebels to somewhat less youthful rebels to stern patriarchs to goofy old men obsessed with their digestive tracts, he has at times seemed inescapable off the movie screen as well. He has spent time in politics, hosted a wildly successful game show, and starred in children's comic books; one fan has even built a temple to worship him as a literal idol.In this course, we will focus on Amitabh Bachchan, not only because he and his films are so interesting, but because he has so much to tell us about how Indian films work and what a star is. Students will have opportunities to think and write, not only about Amitabh and his films, but about film and celebrity more broadly.",

    "ClassOverview": "AY 22-23 How have urban Chinese challenged the authoritarian rule of the Chinese Communist Party in the twenty-first century? What are the activist causes around which urban Chinese have rallied despite the risk of state repression? Given that activists risk persecution, prison, and torture, who would do this? How do activists maintain the emotional resilience to stand up to authoritarian rule? What are activists' tactics and strategies? To answer these questions, we will study reporters, labor organizers, environmental activists, religious activists, lawyers, and feminist activists. Many activists oppose the authoritarian state in the name of freedom. I have found that many urban Chinese are happy, or at least content, in their lives today. The insight that hundreds of millions of people can be happy or content even though they are lacking freedom is so astonishing to me, I have begun to question my own understanding of freedom. Is freedom a specifically Western concept? Should the notion of freedom have universal relevance? Should we demand of the Chinese people that they democratize? Or is this demand Orientalist? Or racist? Is the demand that Chinese democratize another way of saying, \"They must become like us\"? The Chinese Communist Party is a threat to United States democracy. Thinking about China and acting toward China, how are we to combine the defense of our democracy and the injunction to stay clear of Orientalism? Who is a greater threat to our democracy, the Chinese Communist Party or the Republican Party? It turns out that we, unfortunately, cannot study Chinese activists without finding a framework to evaluate Chinese authoritarian rule in political and ethical terms. Evaluating Chinese authoritarian rule involves thinking about ourselves. Are some Americans benefitting from authoritarian rule in China? Is the Chinese Communist Party profitable for some Americans? Would the United States economy collapse without Chinese poverty? Who are we in moral, political, and ethical terms to claim the high ground and criticize the Chinese Communist Party? It is possible to argue that Western modernity is flawed beyond rescue. From this perspective, are we in a desperate search for an alternative modernity? Can China be our inspiration for an alternative modernity? Or, would you agree with those Hong Kong activists who have coined the term Chinazi to indicate that, in their view, China increasingly resembles Hitler's Germany?",

We take as our point of departure Carolyn Bynum's statement: \"No scholar studying religion, no participant in ritual, is ever neuter. Religious experience is the experience of men and women, and in no known society is this experience the same.\" Bearing this in mind, we will explore historical, textual and social questions relevant to gender in the Buddhist worlds of India, Tibet, and the Himalayas from the time of Buddhism's origins to the present day. Topics covered in this course will include the roles of women, men, femininity, and masculinity in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhism and the family, gender and the body in Mahayana Buddhism, the roles of female goddess figures such as dakinisin Vajrayana Buddhism, Buddhism and sexuality, and the status of Buddhist nuns.",

How are these practices related to our everyday experience and immersion in the contemporary global media landscape? What are the social contexts and histories that propel us to study East Asia (East Asian media in this case)? Who constitutes this we? How do we study East Asia while avoiding an orientalist lens in our analysis and othering the other?

It offers a brief history of that field and some of its influential texts as a starting point for thinking through alternative methods of \"doing\" comparative and relational literary and cultural studies today. Of particular concern is the challenge of working within (or between) Eurocentric fields that struggle to make equal space for different traditions and the methods, questions, and theories best suited to them. What does it mean to work in a field that doesn't necessarily understand the work you're doing and why you're doing it? Of equal importance is the challenge of working across fields that are epistemologically and institutionally isolated from one another. How, for example, do you bring insights from other fields (in which you are not formally trained) to bear on your own research, particularly when both home and \"outside\" fields are not in conversation with one another? What does scholarly rigor look like when it comes to interdisciplinary work? We will approach these challenges and questions by looking at recent comparative and interdisciplinary scholarship in several broad fields, including the environmental humanities.",

    "ClassOverview": "The word biology describes both the characteristics and processes of life and living organisms, as well as the discipline that studies these. Like all the natural sciences, the study of biology is a data-driven endeavor, concerned with describing, predicting and understanding natural phenomena based on evidence from observation and experimentation. But like all human activities, it does not exist in objective isolation, but rather within a societal context. And biological phenomena, such as infection and disease, interact with non-biological elements of human society. This course aims to contextualize the study of biology towards a better understanding of how social and cultural histories and dynamics have had a profound effect on both biological research as well as biological phenomena, and how social, political and economic parameters influence the impact of scientific breakthroughs and the outcomes of biological events such as epidemics. The topics we will cover, among others: the cultural, political and societal barriers to reaping the benefits of biological research; the damaging legacies of racism, sexism and colonialism on the biological research enterprise; the role of communications in the field of biology; and select biological topics in evolution, genetics and disease. Students will learn from press articles, academic literature and non-fiction books (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot; Pandemic, by Sonia Shah).",

    "ClassOverview": "Change in the genetic composition of populations over time is the basis of evolution. Evolution occurs when mutation introduces new alleles that replace existing alleles in populations via one of two mechanisms. Replacement can occur by chance (genetic drift) or by encoding a superior phenotype (natural selection). Natural selection produces one of the major features of the living world, adaptation. We will model these processes for single-locus traits, DNA sequences, and phenotypic traits. When populations are separated from one another geographically, they inevitably take different evolutionary paths; it is in this manner that most species are formed. These latter processes-change within lineages and diversification among lineages-have been iterated over staggeringly long periods of time, producing another major feature of the living world, its breathtaking biodiversity. We will familiarize ourselves with the history and diversity of life on earth by examination of the fossil record, and by inferring relationships among species using phylogenetic methods.",

The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector.  The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements.  Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector.  To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management.  Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.  The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.  The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.  This course is an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, learn and apply a new set of skills and knowledge while impacting the community.",

    "ClassOverview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*The instructor of this course is David Lourie.Risk Management is one of the most important business skills every student needs to learn and understand for a successful career.  Organizations are increasingly understanding the lessons learned from the major risk management disasters of this century (e.g., 2008 financial crisis, MF Global, Wells Fargo, Enron, Theranos) and see that lapses in risk management have resulted in significant losses for organizations in diverse industries.  Therefore, organizations have increasingly implemented risk management programs and processes to get ahead of problems before they arise.In recent years, risk management has evolved from a control function (e.g., minimizing risk) to a function that enables performance optimization.  Effective risk management programs can and should both minimize risk while supporting business growth and profitability.  Risk Management is about balancing risk and reward - the best business leaders take intelligent risks by pursuing the right business opportunities given the organization's capabilities.Risk Management effects all areas of an organization and therefore this course will explore risk management in several facets of an organization.  We will study many fascinating areas of risk in this course including operational risk, compliance and regulatory risk, financial risk, insurance, and IT/cybersecurity risk.This class will add significant value to your future careers.  Risk management is ultimately about people because a company's risk profile is driven by the decisions and actions of individual employees.  Risk management will be a part of your future career as an employee no matter what your role - each employee responsible for helping to manage risk.When you understand and implement what we learn in this course, you will be seen as a valuable organizational asset by your employer and be a more effective leader and employee.",

In this seminar, we will discuss what is so special about the size range of 1-100 nm (the nanoscale) and why particles of this size have a such a unique niche in nature and technology. We will explore the properties of these materials and why quantum mechanical effects allow for this scale to be so important. Discussions of medicines, electronics, catalysts, additives, and imaging agents that include nanoparticles will allow us to explore the wide range of current directions of nanotechnology. As we look to future applications, we will debate the implications of these materials on the environment, human health, and safety. Regulatory bodies in the United States and around the globe have discussed the ethical and social impact of nanomaterials, and we will investigate their role is assuring the nanomaterials we use leave a positive impact on the world.",

That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion.  This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results.  For example:- A synthetic chemist must have enough knowledge of reaction mechanisms and synthetic techniques to be able to prepare a specific compound in a single, or more likely, multi-step procedure.  Upon successful preparation of the compound, one must perform a variety of analyses to characterize the sample and confirm that the desired compound has been made.- A physical or analytical chemist who wishes to study the kinetics of a reaction, the spectroscopy of a specific compound, or the use of an analytical technique for characterization of specific compounds often must have the ability to synthesize the compounds of interest.In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis.  You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses.Chemistry 350-1: Roughly half of this course deals with the advanced analytical techniques mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.

The topics are intrinsically technical and rely on some mathematical tools that may be unfamiliar, but effort will be made to keep things as simple as possible (and no simpler). To aid with the intuitive understanding, we will make use of computational techniques for simulating and visualizing these concepts, which will require that students have (or develop) some familiarity with basic computer programming.",

What factors shaped Thucydides' account? And how far can we reconstruct a history of this war independent of his testimony? Weekly two-page papers. No midterm or final exam.",

Along the way, we'll apply the theories and methods of modern fan studies, narratology, and adaptation studies to the evolving story-world of ancient Greek and Roman myth.",

How are these institutions enmeshed with broader cultural and political agendas regarding cultural identity and otherness, the formation of artistic canons, and even the concept of ancient art? This course explores modern strategies of collecting and display of material culture from ancient Egypt, the Middle East, Greece, and Rome, both in Europe and the United States and in their present-day homelands.The course approaches the construction of ancient Mediterranean, Egyptian, and Near Eastern art through modes of reception over the past two centuries. By analyzing programs of collecting and display, it seeks to understand both the development of modern scholarship in ancient art and the intersection of institutional and scholarly programs. Topics examined include the historical development of modern display practices in public and private museums; notions of authenticity and identity; issues of cultural heritage and patrimony; temporary and \"blockbuster\" shows; virtual exhibitions and museums; and the archaeological site as a locus of display. Chicago-area museums will provide important resources for studying firsthand examples of temporary and long-term installations.",

The first three weeks cover aspects of general microeconomics that everyone should know, including how the market system works, how prices are determined, why shortages and surpluses occur, and basic industrial competition. Topics include: supply and demand, competition versus monopoly, comparative advantage in trade, taxation, and market failures. The last two-thirds of the class build on these tools to study the behavior of the economy as a whole, particularly in an international context. Topics include: inflation, unemployment, recessions, booms, fiscal and monetary policy, budget deficits, economic development of nations, international trade, and exchange rates.",

We begin by reviewing existing evidence on the answers to the following questions: How important are fluctuations in the modern U.S.? Why were fluctuations larger in the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century? Who gains and who suffers most because of fluctuations? How is inflation related to economic fluctuations? Why are fluctuations larger in developing economies than in developed economies? To understand the facts that we will document, we will consider modern general equilibrium theories of aggregate fluctuations. One important class of theories, Real Business Cycle theory, stresses the role of fluctuations in the rate of technology change. A different class of theories stresses the role of fluctuations in aggregate demand, including self-fulfilling changes in consumers' expectations. These theories have very different implications for optimal monetary and fiscal policy, which we will explore and evaluate. Finally, we will consider the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the economy.",

We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of platforms featuring network effects that result in a small number of operating systems, streaming services or social networks. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate. We will analyze the ideal scope of artificial monopoly rights and the natural tension between intellectual property and antitrust law.

We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of platforms featuring network effects that result in a small number of operating systems, streaming services or social networks. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate. We will analyze the ideal scope of artificial monopoly rights and the natural tension between intellectual property and antitrust law. Throughout the course we will explore the general topic of regulation and industry cases, both current and historical.",

    "ClassOverview": "This is an introduction to issues in urban and regional economics. We will study the problems of cities, urban areas, and regions by examining the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance. Typically, this will involve reading the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of the papers to get a general overview of the contribution, research question and methodological approach.  We will analyze data using Stata or R and may also use ArcGIS, a digital mapping program.",

    "ClassOverview": "Clarity of expression is no doubt valued in all communication.  But a newcomer to scholarly writing in all fields of study at Northwestern could be forgiven for wondering if many a scholar's goal was in fact confusion if not downright opaqueness.  No matter what your major, you will read critical material by scholars writing from within the discipline, drawing on the methodologies particular to that discipline and on the specialized vocabulary in which arguments are crafted using those methodologies. These materials can read to a novice like the very antithesis of clarity!  And they can tempt a new reader not to fully engage with the argument and therefore potentially miss the point. So we will read a set of them together over the course of the quarter.For comparison and contrast, across the disciplines you will also read material considered to be for the \"general public\" (in The New York Times, The Economist, The Atlantic, for example). What is gained and what is lost when a complicated topic is \"translated\" from \"academic speak\" to \"plain prose\"?Finally, what does it mean to hone your skills of close reading?  It means reading carefully at the level of the sentence; tracing the argument through the sequence of paragraphs; and identifying the evidence - or lack of evidence - so central to any successful argument in all fields.This kind of reading enables sophisticated analysis and critique, the goal of this class for your written assignments as well as your contribution to class discussion.  As your close reading skills become more advanced, your participation in discussions and your own critical analysis in writing will advance.We will read scholarly material across the social sciences, sciences, and humanities, including quite a number of articles by Northwestern professors.

    "ClassOverview": "It is said that the Victorians invented the idea of childhood: an idyllic state of wonder, play, imagination, and innocence. The orphans, adventurers, tricksters, and runaways in Victorian children's novels befriend animals, outsmart pirates, soar through the London sky, and fall down rabbit holes. What made these stories so popular in the nineteenth century, and why do they continue to enchant readers today? This course will explore key works of the Victorian literature canon to consider how these various narratives reflect rapidly transforming conceptions of childhood during the nineteenth century. From Lewis Carroll's playfully puzzling Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to Rudyard Kipling's novel of colonial espionage, Kim, Victorian children's novels offer a unique perspective on a world in the grip of profound political, economic, and religious change. As we read, we will also reflect on the categories of the human and the animal, the nature of child sexuality, the distinctions drawn between innocence and maturity, as well as differences in gender, race, class, and disability. How does the constructed representation of \"the child\" speak to the desires, ambitions, and anxieties of a given historical moment? And what does the very category of children's literature suggest about literature's purpose and value?",

This first-year seminar will immerse you in Chicago, guiding you through an investigation of its rich literary and cultural life. Reading stories of the city's recent past like The Devil in the White City and Native Son, learning about today's writing scene through the iconic local magazine Poetry, studying the Chicago Blues that developed after the Great Migration, and shuttling down to our world-class libraries, students will gain a profound understanding of the city that starts just two miles south of campus. We will hold screenings of some of the best depictions of the city on film, including Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Chi-Raq.

The books we read in this course are studies of emotional over-investment and varieties of censorship, addressing when and how literature and reading become dangerous (whether to individuals, social values, or the powers that be). How does reading lead to devotion, enthusiasm, madness, or transgression? And how do these effects prove revelatory? How are concerns about the effects of reading and the spread of literacy motivated by the desire to control information, freedom, and social mobility? Broadly speaking, how do reading and literary interpretation teach us new techniques for how (or how not) to interpret the world?

That such seemingly vague terminologies nevertheless reflect a certain precision of judgment is testament to their potency as both evaluative criteria (\"big mood,\" \"it's a vibe\") and aesthetic problem (what is vaporwave, exactly?), especially in a world predicated on the patterns and habits of commodity forms. Drawing from art objects and literary texts, this course will ask you to read across materialities and mediums with the aim of elaborating the relationships between the following concepts: race, media, d\u00e9cor, pattern, texture, scent, and ornament. What does the proliferation of nuclear technologies after 1945 have to do with elevator music? How might the history of air conditioning tell us something about Asian America after the Cold War?

In this course, we will focus on works of fiction and autobiography that pay special attention to the role that college plays in that journey. These works portray the formative childhood influences and conflicts that shape the protagonists. In the chapters on college, they dramatize the different ways that higher education helps the characters navigate the difficult and confusing task of taking control of their lives and coming to a deeper understanding of who they are and what they want from life. In each work, we also get to see the impact of their college experiences after the characters have graduated and entered the so-called \"real world.\" The works explore such questions as: Does college change who you are or, rather, help you to understand who you are? How does it impact your relationships with your family? What factors contribute to success in college and beyond, and what is even meant by \"success\"? Through reflection on and discussion, you'll begin to answer those and other questions for yourself too. We will read a variety of books that include: Bread Givers, a novel about a Jewish girl struggling with poverty at the turn of the 20th century; A Particular Kind of Black Man, a novel about the child of Nigerian immigrants who faces discrimination not only from white people but from African Americans; Educated, a memoir about a girl who grows up in an isolated, rural community with almost no formal education; and other literary works. In each work, college is a turning point for the main character, helping them to mature and move forward in their lives with clearer self-understanding and sense of purpose. The readings will offer you the opportunity not only to enjoy and discuss some wonderful books but also to reflect on the path that has led you to Northwestern and the ways you hope you will continue to grow and mature while you're here.",

In other words, the seminar is designed to help you make the transition to a college mindset. We will begin the seminar by quickly exploring a few controversial topics, evaluating how well writers in both the scholarly and the popular press support their opinions and persuade audiences. In the process, you will learn how to evaluate sources, read critically, listen and consider opposing points of view, and develop a powerful response. Then you will have the opportunity to select a controversial topic of your choice and research it in depth, using library resources, the Internet, interviews, and surveys. In addition to learning research techniques, you will also learn techniques for presenting your ideas persuasively, both orally and in writing. By the end of the course, you will be in position to discuss your ideas in a thoughtful, authoritative way, becoming a more effective contributor in college classes as well as in conversations with family and friends.

For instance, the optimism and creativity that often characterize youth can lead to positive social and societal change. At the same time, though, young people often struggle to be taken seriously, even when their actions and ideas are good ones. Through examining several historic and contemporary case studies, this course will explore both the triumphs and terrors of youth (i.e., teens-twenties). What risks are uniquely available to young people? Which ones are rewarded and which end in regret? How might these outcomes be mediated by other factors (e.g., race, gender, sexuality)? Most importantly, what can we learn from the triumphant and terrible behaviors of others? As we explore answers to these questions through discussion, reading, and writing assignments, we'll also take advantage of your own uniquely youthful status as first-quarter, first-year students. Specifically, we'll think and learn about how both your transition to college and the years ahead present you with opportunities to both capitalize on your youth and cultivate for you and others (especially those who might disparage Gen Z) a more realistic idea of what it really means to be young these days.",

Identity forms an important part of our development, both inside university and outside academia. While we may assume one identity within the university, we may assume an entirely different identity within friend groups or within our families. The intersectionality of identity plays a pivotal role in shaping our world view. It's also important to consider within the academic setting, as you begin to connect with others from different backgrounds who will form the basis of your peer and academic support and learning groups over the next four years. This class will explore the shaping of identity. You will have the opportunity to explore your own identities, both within university and outside academia. You will also explore how others shape their identities. Of particular emphasis will be the intersectionality of identity. We will consider elements such as sexual orientation, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and race. Emphasis will be placed on identity-shaping phenomena such as life experiences, socialization within communities and families, and popular culture. Together, we will come to a deeper understanding of identity. The culminating project of the class will be a \"first-quarter-of-college identity\" time capsule.

Through exercises and projects, you'll practice using these tools to produce original, exciting works of literary art. Along the way, you'll sharpen your ability to track these elements both in published texts and in the work of your classmates, and further develop how you measure aesthetic value. You'll be encouraged to see yourself as an active member of a community of artists, and to establish a regular discipline as a working writer. Writing and reading will be due in nearly every class, and peer workshop will play an important role in learning to see your work more objectively.",

John Donne was an Anglican priest, who preached to thousands as the Dean of St Paul's in London. George Herbert was a parish priest in a small village who wrote about the duties of his office. John Milton engaged in high-risk political efforts to transform England into the new Promised Land. This course will focus on the religious controversies that prevailed in early modern England and the ways these thinkers responded to them in their poetry. The controversies issued in new definitions of what the Good is, how power should be apportioned, and how signs have meaning. The specific arguments can seem odd in our more secular era: Why was so much blood shed over the meaning of the wafer and the wine in the Mass? Why were there fights over where the altar was placed in the church? But our goal will be to understand what was at stake in these and related questions as they are engaged in the very different styles of Donne, Milton and Herbert.",

The course is practical in that it is designed to prepare incoming tutors for their work at the Writing Place. This course also focuses heavily on both classic and current theories of the teaching of writing and of writing center-specific pedagogies. We will introduce you to classic works of writing center theory while also asking you to engage in more contemporary debates and studies in the field. Through a combination of reading about writing center pedagogies and practicing engaging with those methods in your work at the Writing Place, Practical Rhetoric seeks to prepare you to effectively coach writers at all stages of the writing process. In the spirit of the collaborative writing process that is at the heart of the Writing Place's mission, as writers this quarter, this course will ask you to regularly bring your own writing to class to workshop in a series of mock consultations and writing exercises with your classmates. You will reflect on your own positionality as a writer-- and consider what that positionality brings to your work at the Writing Place-- in a short writing assignment the first week of the quarter. You will continue to reflect on your learning in Practical Rhetoric and on your experiences working at the Writing Place in a series of weekly tutor journals. We will ask you to contribute to the work of writing center studies through your own research proposal, ideally on a topic or initiative that you can continue developing and perhaps even put into action in later quarters to improve and grow our services at the Writing Place. And at the end of the quarter, you'll bring everything you've learned together to articulate your personal tutoring philosophy.",

Although imitation in poetry has been practiced publicly and privately for centuries, its critics consider it an inherently stifled process\u2014one that yields unoriginal and derivate poetry, necessary only for those without imagination or skill. In this advanced poetry writing seminar, we will challenge those notions and embrace imitation as a mode not only of composition but of reading. We will investigate how poets employ the formal attributes of poetry\u2014line and stanza, musicality, syntax, image, metaphor and simile, etc.\u2014to create successful poems. We will then apply those observations to our own drafts. In this way, we will explore how \"imitating\" the poems of others can, in fact, activate our own creativity and aid us in developing our poetic voices and a poetry that is uniquely \"ours.\"",

    "ClassOverview": "This class will investigate the roots of the modern science fiction novel as it emerged in the post-war period of the 20th century through the lens of three major, prolific writers of the period: Samuel R. Delaney, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Octavia E. Butler. These three writers have only recently begun to be recognized for making vital contributions not only to science fiction\u2014historically disparaged as a popular, pulpy genre\u2014but literature more broadly. Science fiction is conventionally viewed as an overwhelmingly white, male-dominated genre, but Le Guin, Butler, and Delaney prove the contrary: variously female, Black, and queer, each of these writers proved formative to the genre's development in their fearless explorations of race, gender, sexuality, and ability during the 1960's and 70's. We will read major works across each writer's oeuvre to analyze their particular contributions to how we define science fiction as a narrative category. What does it mean to consider genre fiction as less artistically sophisticated, less serious than literary fiction, when sci-fi has always been invested in reimagining the stories we tell about ourselves? Butler, Le Guin, and Delaney each interrogate traditional ideas of narrative conflict and form, in addition to the ways we might imagine our collective future by unflinchingly facing our present moment. What space did science fiction afford these writers to reimagine erotics, environmental thought, utopian politics, and social care? We will approach these questions by considering the depiction of science in these novels, and how these posited technologies intersect with experiments in race, gender, and sexuality, keeping in mind the genre's coexistence with civil rights and feminist movements across the country.",

    "ClassOverview": "Though he doesn't boast the name recognition of William Shakespeare or John Milton, Edmund Spenser holds the perhaps-dubious honor of having written the longest extant poem in English. His poem The Faerie Queene, published in two installments in1590 and 1596, clocks in at 34,928 lines\u2014and remains only half-finished at that length. At once a Christian allegory, an Arthurian legend, a chivalric epic-romance, and a nationalistic paean to Queen Elizabeth, The Faerie Queene is a storehouse of material for a range of popular literature, including Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, C.S. Lewis's Narnia series, and (perhaps less directly) George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones. Like the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Perrault, or the Brothers Grimm, Spenser's poem includes not only knights and ladies and fire-breathing dragons (though it does have those), but also the darkest elements of human psychology and behavior, on scales both personal and national, from suicide to genocide. In reading roughly half of The Faerie Queene, alongside selected supplemental materials, this course will use Spenser as a case study in how to approach literary and cultural materials that have the capacity both to delight and horrify us as twenty-first-century readers. What is it about Spenser's poem that has made four hundred years of readers value him as part of the Western canon? What are some of the political and ethical problems that are raised by his work? How do we weigh our responsibility to know and confront our cultural history against our loathing of some of the ideologies and behaviors that authors such as Spenser have transmitted to us?",

    "ClassOverview": "While many of them are set among courts and kings, Shakespeare's plays explore experiences and perspectives of those outside prevailing circles of power and social acceptance of his time: the poor, women, the young and the old, members of racial and religious communities different from the dominant ones in England.  Shakespeare himself fell into some of these categories of \"otherness\"; as actors without fixed social status, so did his colleagues; as a woman ruler, so for that matter did his Queen.  Readers and interpreters of Shakespeare have found in his representations of other identities much to praise and much to question, but they have found common material to think with.  Given Shakespeare's unique status within anglophone and world literatures, Shakespeare's writings are rich ground for posing questions of otherness, identity, and empathy, of commonality, belonging, and difference.  In this class we will take up some of the cues from Shakespeare's plays, their insights and oversights, and investigate how Shakespeare, and others, responded to people imagined to be somehow different.",

    "ClassOverview": "This class will examine lesbian representation in film and television over the last four decades. \"Representation\" is a tricky word in politics and media: queer communities, communities of color, and disabled communities (and those categories overlap in important ways) have pushed for more representation in film, television, the music industry, and publishing. Lesbian women have long complained of the community's invisibility. At the same time, minoritized communities must grapple with the fact that simple representation can be a mixed bag. If the primary goal is visibility, is all representation good representation? Are lesbian villains, or lesbians who are narratively punished, still politically useful?  Does the inclusion of a lesbian character (or lesbian characters) \"count\" if no one involved in the production of the object was themselves a lesbian? This course will explore these questions and more, discussing theoretical readings from cultural studies alongside our primary films, television, music, and print media. We will consider the difficult and derogatory tropes that are part and parcel of lesbian representation in the media, but we will engage most intensively with narratives that have attempted to expand the narrative potential of queer female life and to affirm lesbian identities\u2014with complex results.",

    "ClassOverview": "Graphic novels have recently achieved a place in literature far from their origins in serials and superhero stories. From retellings of classic novels, to fantasy epics, to published compendiums of webcomics, the graphic novel is one of the fastest growing genres. In particular, graphic novels have become an important site through which to retell individual and collective histories, from coming-out memoirs to indigenous retellings of historical events usually occluded from Western history books. This class will focus on the graphic novel as a form of life-writing that documents both personal and social histories. How does the graphic novel's form make it particularly suited for this kind of work? What kinds of political visions of the past are graphic novels contesting and rewriting? And how does the graphic novel's popularity influence our understanding of the digital age and its dissemination of information? Reading texts such as Art Spiegelman's Maus and Maia Kobabe's Gender Queer, both texts recently at the center of controversial school bans, we will investigate how these books aim to retell history and how their visual form influences the debate about their place in schools. What political possibilities do such texts offer us as they write their graphic lives?",

How might studying sitcoms help us understand narrative, nostalgia, or even how we read? What social formations can the sitcom represent or imagine? In this class we will study the sitcom by looking at traditional examples, recent revivals, and boundary-pushing experiments alongside short fiction, essays, and theory that will help us interrogate the form.

How have Indigenous writers used novels, newspapers, and films to document, critique, or inspire protests seeking a different world?  This course examines the interrelated stories of Native American literatures & resistance movements.  Focusing on novels by Leslie Marmon Silko (Laguna Pueblo), Tommy Orange (Cheyenne & Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma), Louise Erdrich (Turtle Mountain Ojibwe), and Cherie Dimaline (M\u00e9tis), we will ask how literature participates in and is indebted to activist movements, from occupations of federal prisons in the mid-twentieth century to the nonviolent resistance protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline in the twenty-first.  We'll examine how writers like Louise Erdrich have used fiction to intervene in legal protections for Indigenous women.  And we'll examine how speculative fiction like The Marrow Thieves imagines beyond a world shaped by colonialism and climate change.  By pairing these literary texts with Indigenous Studies scholarship, we'll examine the different approaches Indigenous writers have taken to questions of sovereignty, environmental justice, legal jurisdiction, and political recognition. Readings include: Leslie Marmon Silko, Ceremony; Tommy Orange, There There; Louise Erdrich, The Round House; Cherie Dimaline, The Marrow Thieves; \"Women and Standing Rock\" section in Orion Magazine; and short accompanying readings.",

    "ClassOverview": "How is it that a minimally-educated Brooklyn carpenter and journeyman printer became an indispensable figure in US literary history and poetics?  This question is the point of departure for a sweeping seminar on Walt Whitman's writings, early, middle and late.  Extending from virtually one end of the nineteenth century to the other, Whitman's career also provides an opportunity to engage with crucial events in US history, not least slavery, the Civil War, and its aftermath, especially as he treated these events in poetry (Drum-Taps), and in prose (Specimen Days).  Starting with Whitman's journalism, novels, and short stories, we'll then turn to his magnum opus, Leaves of Grass, first published in 1855, and the focus of his career for the next forty years.  Wherever possible, we'll read Whitman's writings in facsimile--that is, as reprints of the forms in which they first circulated, which is an especially appropriate way to study the writings of this poet who was also a printer, and who took a hands-on approach to the publication of his works.  Finally, at course's end we'll survey the voluminous number of poets, artists, writers, and free thinkers of all stripes for whom Whitman has figured as spiritual inspiration.",

Their aesthetic innovation often depicted art and love (or sex) as parallel (or contradictory) ways to create meaning the wasteland of Modernity.

Along the way we may ask: What do the comedic conventions of Western classical drama, the medieval genre of \"romance,\" or the political aesthetics of Romanticism have to do with the romantic comedy as it exists today? The anarchic space of comedy is usually understood to grant the genre a subversive potential using absurdism or satire to reimagine power dynamics or to question social norms governing gender, sexuality, race, and family. One question we will ask throughout is: Does the romantic comedy threaten to tame that subversive potential? Or does it promise to release its chaotic energies in ever renewed ways? Students will regularly be asked to watch two movies in a single week. Apart from writing several papers for the course, students will also present on an episode, scene, or clip from a recent TV show that helps us understood the genre and its history.",

She could not have imagined the extent to which Frankenstein would persist in popular culture. This class will consider the retellings, adaptations, appropriations, and parodies of Frankenstein. We will consider what aspects of Shelley's novel have survived in the popular imagination, and what we have changed. Why did the creature turn from a well-spoken, self-educated subject into a green, non-speaking monster? What lessons have we drawn from Dr. Frankenstein's ill-fated experiment? When and how have marginalized writers (re)claimed the creature as a figure of the oppressed? Why has Shelley's sentimental and atmospheric gothic novel inspired so much levity and humor? From the 1931 film adaptation to Susan Stryker's expression of trans rage in \"My Words to Victor Frankenstein\" (1994); from the beloved parody Young Frankenstein (1974) to Victor LaVelle's graphic novella series Destroyer (2017-), there seems to be no bottom to the relevance of Shelley's classic novel.

We are the inheritors, perpetuators and innovators of literary culture, and in this class, we will position our inquiries on the present and future, even as we acknowledge the enduring humanistic values of creative writing. We will begin with a discussion of ideas about shaping the literary traditions of the United States starting with Melville, and moving quickly to those who have led or lead in shaping that tradition by shaping it or walking away from it\u2014Roxane Gay, Adrienne Rich, Richard Baldwin, and others. Then we will build on these ideas practically with a service learning assignment and a creative work that reaches a new public, coordinates new media or engenders community. Our class will be enhanced by the annual Return Engagement series, featuring visits and readings from alumni of Northwestern's Writing Program. My intention is to have a conversation that will unfold in real-time between us all, and will evolve into a learning experience that is both pragmatically useful and philosophically illuminating.

The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry\u2014including description, rhetoric, story and song\u2014and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning.

    "ClassOverview": "Near the turn of the millennium, an astute reader labeled a mixed bag of books as \"systems fictions\" or \"network narratives.\"  These works\u2014DeLillo's Underworld, Pynchon's Mason & Dixon, Silko's Almanac of the Dead, and others\u2014assumed the multiple, shifting viewpoints of huge varieties of characters on dizzyingly ramifying plots; dashed across vast ranges of time and space; and experimented formally, structurally, and stylistically, not always successfully, addressing themselves to the interdependent complexities of the world by imitating as well as representing them.  A wider sweep places such works not as a peculiar style of the millennium, but as recurring features of literary history, from the premodern romance traditions of Spenser's Faerie Queene to modernist collages like Joyce's Ulysses to post-millennial works like Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, Catton's The Luminaries, or Yanagihara's To Paradise.  These works have in common a reluctance to reduce the world to the scale of a single human consciousness, aiming instead at rendering its other patterns.  Collectively they ask, What does literature know that cannot be known in other ways?  What does it represent that cannot otherwise be represented?  In this seminar we will explore the premises and efforts of several such texts, following their signal in dislocating their form of writing to earlier historical moments.",

    "ClassOverview": "Spenserians have often identified their scholarship more closely with medieval studies than with early modern\u2014understandably, given Spenser's deliberate archaism and his particular debts to Chaucer. The International Spenser Society, for instance, hosts its annual open-submission Spenser panels not at the Renaissance Society of America conference but the Medieval Congress at Kalamazoo. Accordingly, it has been only in recent years\u2014as medieval scholars have worked to counter right-wing appropriations of medieval symbols and demonstrably false claims about the past\u2014that Spenserians have been forced to reckon with race in ways that go beyond Spenser's direct implication in Irish colonialism. In this course, we will read Spenserian texts--including approximately half of The Faerie Queene and A Viewe of the Present State of Ireland\u2014paying particular attention to Spenser's religious extremism; his deployment of medieval racial tropes (such as the \"Saracen\"); and his advocacy of the brutal English colonial project in Ireland. We will also devote ourselves to a critical interrogation of Spenserian criticism\u2014including the longstanding conversation about Spenser's anti-Irish ideology and politics, the 2021 special issue of Spenser Studies on \"Spenser and Race,\" and the critics who have addressed the racialized portrayal of Jews, Muslims, Amerindians, and Africans in Spenser. We will consider these local critical conversations in the context of, and in comparison to, broader conversations in early modern studies about race and ethnicity (featuring such critics as Ania Loomba, Ayanna Thompson Mary Floyd Wilson, Kim F. Hall, Janet Adelman, and Dympna Callaghan). Dividing our attentions between primary texts and critical evaluation of the scholarship will make this course useful, I hope, both to early modernists seeking a deeper understanding of the field and to non-specialists interested in the literary history of racial and racist rhetoric.",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar will offer an introduction and survey of two fields: the literary historical field of early Indigenous literatures and the interdisciplinary field of Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS).  Reading texts created by Indigenous writers and printers between 1661 and around 1900, we will ground ourselves in the genres, modes of production, and politics of early Indigenous literatures, while also critically examining what terms like \"early\" and \"literature\" mean in this context and with attention to the reading, archival, and collaborative practices necessary to study this literary history. We will read this literary archive alongside NAIS scholarship, with a focus on keywords significant to the field, including but not limited to sovereignty, settler colonialism, land, recognition, refusal, and resurgence, transIndigenous, and decolonial.  Readings include works by Samson Occom, Joseph Johnson, Hendrick Aupaumut, Katharine Garret, William Apess, Black Hawk, Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, E. Pauline Johnson, Simon Pokagon, Gertrude Bonnin and others; scholarly work by Robert Warrior, Audra Simpson, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, David Chang, Mishuana Goeman, Jean Dennison, and Joanne Barker, among others. This course will meet both the 1680-1800 and the 1800-1900 period requirements.",

    "ClassOverview": "The primary text for English 497, the Fiction Workshop, is the work written by the people in the class.  Writing is the only art with an abstract medium: language. But like every other art, writing is about making something.  Musicians make music, potters make pots, painters make paintings, and writers make stories and novels.  One learns to make pots through the trial and error of making pots.  The analogy holds for writing; one learns to write by doing: writing and rewriting.  It is the craft of each art that can be learned, and it is craft that the artist relies on to make and improve a piece.  And so the writing workshop is craft oriented.  Because the medium, language, is an abstraction, the tools of writing stories--which are central to human thought--are not pens or typewriters or computers, but abstractions: scenic construction, dialogue, etc.  That's what governs improving one's in-process work and that is what we come together to discuss in each class.  The stories that people in the class are working on will organically lead to discussions about the craft of writing that will apply not just to that particular story, but to the art of writing in general--to all our stories.  In critiquing a fellow writer's story, one is also, on the deepest level, engaged in articulating a personal aesthetic.  The idea of a workshop is to then harness the clarity of those personal articulations back into one's own writing.",

How might we \"re-enchant\" our understanding of the human beyond limited views that have shaped the West historically through colonialism and imperialism? How might we imagine a humanism that would be centered on repair, care, sustainability, and justice? This seminar will examine several literary works of science fiction and seminal theories of humanism and post-humanism to address these questions. Embracing a historical approach, we will explore various conceptions of the human and subjectivity from the discovery of the New World to the present day. We will trace how redefining humanism entails addressing problems pertaining to theories of the affects and emotions, media, and technology while looking at the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality.",

How do the history and memory of migrants and refugees shape the literary imaginary of cities and inform migratory policies? This course will explore these questions by looking at literature emerging from and located in Marseille. Marseille often presents itself as a cosmopolitan city, une ville d'acceuil. One of the oldest ports in Europe, it has been the home of travelers, migrants, refugees, and foreigners for centuries. By examining travel logs, memoirs, novels, poems, and plays, from the nineteenth century to the present, we will analyze how Marseille offered, on the one hand, a view of the colonial world and, on the other, a home for writers in exile. In a political context where nationalism gains power and territory across the globe, we will ask what model literature of Marseille might offer to reimagine the world and conceive of cultural diversity and belonging beyond citizenships and nation buildings.",

We explore the challenges posed to the traditional republican notion of French national identity by colonial history, decolonization, immigration, and globalization by studying a wide range of documents, texts, and films that portray individual and collective experiences. Drawing on the notion of \"la France en mutation / changing France,\" we study how historical events and French institutions (especially the state and the school) shape identities. Students gain an understanding of questions relating to social inequalities and diversities from a \"French Global\" perspective, while focusing on French definitions and experiences of (in)equality and diversity, and how these play out in terms of race and ethnicity, gender, class, and sexual orientation. Conducted entirely in French, this course is designed to increase students' ability to speak, read, and write in French, and improve their aural comprehension.

    "ClassOverview": "Marcel Proust's work foregrounds two tasks of the work of art. First, art provides a locus for thinking our relationship to the past: it serves as the site in which the different worlds and selves through which we have passed can coexist with and communicate with one another. But for Proust art also has a privileged relation to the transformative power of the involuntary: it creates the forms through which we can articulate our relationship to the desires, sensations and events for which our existing forms of life and representation have least prepared us.  This course will begin by examining the ways in which these two tasks are intertwined in Proust, with a particular emphasis on the ways in which his aesthetic and ethical elaboration of these problems situates his work in the history of modernism. In the second half of the course, we will turn to the ways in which these two tasks of the work of art are rethought in the works of two of Proust's inheritors and filmmakers\u2014writer Jean Genet and filmmaker Chris Marker\u2014who, even as they engage Proust's legacy, can no longer presuppose the aesthetic, discursive and institutional forms of modernism. In Genet's autobiographical and political fictions, and in Marker's cinematic works of Chris Marker, the relationship between memory and the involuntary are intertwined in new ways, which oblige us both to rethink the place and function of aesthetic experience in culture after modernism and to reconsider the potential importance of the Proustian legacy in elaborating an aesthetic politics that resists postmodernity's dominant cultural forms.",

As an introductory course on global health, the class delves into comparative health systems, including comparative health systems in high- and low-income countries. Key topics will include: policies and approaches to global health, key actors in global health, comparative health systems, structural violence, gender and reproductive health, chronic and communicable diseases, politics of global health research and evidence, and the ethics of global health equity.",

    "ClassOverview": "The human body is embedded into a health framework that can produce hypervisibility, invisibility, or both. This course in social science and medical anthropology examines the role of social markers of difference, including race, class, gender, sexuality, age, and religion, in current debates and challenges in the theory and practice of global health. We will explore recent illness experiences, therapeutic and self-care interventions, and health practices and behaviors in socio-cultural and historical context through case studies in the U.S., Brazil, and South Africa. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to key concepts such as embodiment, medicalization, structural violence, social determinants of health, biopolitics, health equity, and an ethic of care. Central questions of the course include: How do categories of \"Othering\" determine disease and health in individuals and collectives? How is medical science and care influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient trust? How do social and economic inclusion/exclusion control access to health treatment and self-care and care of others? This course focuses on the linkages between society and health inequalities in the U.S. and economic powers. It offers a forum to explore policy application with a particular emphasis on definitions that form social factors. This course utilizes historical accounts, contemporary ethnographies, Twitter threads of health experiences, public health literature, media reports, TedTalks, and films to bring to life the \"why's\" of health differences.",

    "ClassOverview": "Global health is a popular field of work and study for Americans, with an increasing number of medical trainees and practitioners, as well as people without medical training, going abroad to volunteer in areas where there are few health care practitioners or resources. In addition, college undergraduates, as well as medical trainees and practitioners, are going abroad in increasing numbers to conduct research in areas with few healthcare resources. But all of these endeavors, though often entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas, and can have unintended consequences. In this course, students will explore and consider these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core global bioethical concerns - such as structural violence - and core global bioethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as beneficence and solidarity - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the central goal of global health: reducing health inequities. With an emphasis on the ethical responsibility to reduce inequities, we consider some of the most pressing global bioethical issues of our time: equity, fairness, and planetary health. Particular attention is given to the ethics of research during a pandemic and equitable access to vaccines and therapies for Covid-19.

    "ClassOverview": "Since the early 2000s, there has been an explosion of interest in volunteering in low-income communities: within orphanages, clinics, schools, conservation projects, refugee camps, and housing projects. At the same time, volunteering has become a significant issue of public debate, as unintended consequences of people's best intentions are brought to light in the popular press and in academic literature. This class explores the ethics of altruism through the discourses and practices that make up volunteering and voluntourism, from the perspectives of volunteers, hosts, and a range of others both promoting and critiquing volunteerism. What motivates people to  volunteer among strangers or in unfamiliar contexts, and what are the implications of these voluntary exchanges for the volunteers, and for the communities and institutions where volunteering takes place? What are the ethics and values that make up \"making a difference\" among differently-situated players involved in volunteering? Given that volunteers often act upon best intentions, what are the logics and values that justify altruistic action, and the differential standards by which volunteers are judged based on where they go and how they engage in volunteering? What kinds of unintended consequences come about through voluntary action? This class highlights the need go beyond the adage \"any help is better than no help at all,\" and instead bring critical thinking to altruistic intentions.",

Our focus will be on human reproduction, considering the vantage points of both healthcare practitioners and lay women and men. We will look at ideas concerning fertility, conception, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, birth control, abortion, and assisted reproduction. Because, at a fundamental level, reproduction is about power - as historian Amy Kaler (but by no means only Kaler), pointed out, \"[c]ontrol over human reproduction is eternally contested, in zones ranging from the comparative privacy of the conjugal bedroom to the political platform and programs of national polities\" - we will pay attention to power in reproductive health. And, since the distribution of power in matters of reproduction has often been uneven and unequal - between men and women, between colonizing and Indigenous populations, between clinicians and lay people, between those in upper socioeconomic classes and those in lower socioeconomic classes - we will pay particular attention during this class to struggles over matters of reproduction as we explore historical changes and continuities in reproduction globally since 1900.",

Starting from Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten's emphatic appropriation the term \"aesthetics\" to designate the study of beauty and good taste, the course will move chronologically through major texts of aesthetic theory from the eighteenth to the twenty-first century. The course will both examine the specific problems and questions raised by the various texts and consider the texts as history, looking at the ways in which these works both respond to one another and to the political and cultural tensions of their respective eras. We will also consider the ways in which these texts cross disciplinary boundaries or indeed are always already transdisciplinary, constantly moving from the comparatively narrow fields of artistic and literary criticism to fundamental issues of ethics, epistemology, politics, and psychology, and back and forth all over again, always asking ourselves the questions: What are the historical conditions of the ways in which we make and/or think about works of art, broadly conceived, and how does this, in turn, shape the world that art is said to reflect?",

What new forms of knowledge and ways of knowing, political tools and ways of doing politics does this insight make possible? And how can we use these to make sense of and respond to the urgencies of the present moment? In this seminar we will focus on \"intersectionality\" as a mode of feminist critical inquiry and activist practice (or \"critical praxis\") forged by Black feminists. As Patricia Hill Collins explains, \"The term intersectionality references the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities.\" Together we will read foundational texts by Collins and other Black feminist scholars and activists to understand and explore this critical insight and the coalitional politics that an intersectional analysis both demands and makes possible. We will pair these readings with collective research into both past and present projects that engage this form of Black feminist \"critical praxis\" to respond to complex social inequalities, including Black Lives Matter, the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, and the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Work & Occupations: Focus on Gender.The gender division of labor is a key organizing principle in all known societies, but it takes a fascinating array of forms. In industrialized and post-industrial societies, women have increasingly taken up paid employment and moved into formerly-masculine fields, driven by demand for women workers as the economy shifts toward the service sector, and more recently by feminist movements. Yet women are still doing the majority of caring and household labor, while men's take-up of traditionally feminine caring labor has been far more limited. Moreover, the sex segregation of occupations and substantial gendered earnings gaps remain. Meanwhile, much of the work formerly done by housewives has been \"outsourced\" to paid service workers, many of whom migrate from global South to global North to take up this work. Scholars debate about whether and how these arrangements will change, and whether they may be influenced by political initiatives, either top-down (e.g., affirmative action to recruit women to STEM fields) or bottom-up (e.g., cultural and media campaigns to validate new norms). In this course, we will investigate the ways in which work - paid and unpaid, in families and in places of employment - is organized by gender and other forms of power, difference and inequality, such as race, class and migration/citizenship status. We will examine family divisions of labor across diverse households: how do men and women divide domestic work and care for children or others needing care? Where does non-familial provision come into play? What are the consequences for outcomes in paid employment and in terms of the distribution of time, respect, and power? We will learn about the development of the modern economy and occupational sex segregation, as well as how different kinds of men, women and others are treated at work. Finally, we will consider the role of government policy in sustaining or changing these arrangements.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Political Sociology: Gender, Power, Politics.This class will investigate how gender shapes politics and policy, and how these in turn shape gender, in the United States and other countries, situated in global context. Gender is conceptualized as a set of relations, identities and cultural schema, always constituted with other dimensions of power, difference and inequality (e.g., race, class, sexuality, religion, citizenship status). We will analyze the gendered character of citizenship, political participation and representation, social rights and economic rights. We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy and citizenship? How has feminism emerged as a radical challenge to the androcentrism and restricted character of the democratic public sphere? And how has anti-feminism come to be a significant dimension of politics? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include the grassroots democratic activism that gave birth to modern women's movements. We explore how women's political efforts have given rise to the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as reshaping formal politics and policies. And, finally, we will take advantage of the fact that we are in the middle of an election to examine some of the gendered aspects of the political landscape in the contemporary United States.The course readings feature different types of materials - original documents, scholarly books and articles, a textbook, policy reports, popular non-fiction work on aspects of gender, policy, politics and society.

Using Gender, Queer, Trans, Asian American, and Digital Humanities Theories, we will discuss the cross-cultural intersections, dialogues, refusals, and adaptions when thinking about medical travel to Thailand for gender/sex related surgeries. We will examine Thai cultural/historical conceptions of sex and gender, debates concerning bodies and diagnoses, and changes in presentations of sex/gender related surgeries offered online. We will also explore how digital archives are created and managed. Investigating transcripts of live interviews, medical discourses, and an archive of web images offering GAS surgeries produced by Thais for non-Thais will serve as axes for investigating this topic.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Lesbian Representation in Popular CultureThis class will examine lesbian representation in film and television over the last four decades. \"Representation\" is a tricky word in politics and media: queer communities, communities of color, and disabled communities (and those categories overlap in important ways) have pushed for more representation in film, television, the music industry, and publishing. Lesbian women have long complained of the community's invisibility. At the same time, minoritized communities must grapple with the fact that simple representation can be a mixed bag. If the primary goal is visibility, is all representation good representation? Are lesbian villains, or lesbians who are narratively punished, still politically useful? Does the inclusion of a lesbian character (or lesbian characters) \"count\" if no one involved in the production of the object was themselves a lesbian? This course will explore these questions and more, discussing theoretical readings from cultural studies alongside our primary films, television, music, and print media. We will consider the difficult and derogatory tropes that are part and parcel of lesbian representation in the media, but we will engage most intensively with narratives that have attempted to expand the narrative potential of queer female life and to affirm lesbian identities\u2014with complex results.",

This course will introduce students upon methods sound studies, ethnomusicology, affect theory, queer studies, urban studies, and the critical geography of race. In addition to reading and regular writing assignments, students will engage in ethnographic work in Chicago throughout the quarter.Chicago will be our main field site, however we will take a comparative approach and bring in other cities in the global south and north as points of reference. Topics may include the Chicago House scene, drag culture, the South Side's configuration a racialized and eroticized space, the development of noise codes to constrain queer domestic life, the role of music as erotic force in the clubs of Boystown, musical performances in bath houses, and the opera house as a site of gay male desire and community. All of these spaces offer ways to think of the importance of sound and music in the production of queer affect and urban sociability.",

Sometimes cyberspace is depicted as a continuation of previous media such as television, cinema or telephone, but often it is envisioned as a new frontier. This course will examine the ways in which virtual media appears in cultural discourses. We consider how technological objects and tools participate in shaping elements of our culture that may appear natural, logical, or timeless. Our guiding questions will include the following: In what ways are these narratives shaping collective perceptions of the internet? How have virtual technologies challenged experiences of language, gender, community and identity? We will focus on social networking, gaming, artificial intelligence, and literary and filmic representations of these. Following a Cultural Studies model for inquiry, this course will be project-based and experiential. Your attendance and participation are mandatory.

As loci of meaning-making, hierarchical differentiation, and political struggles, as well as the space of transgressive imagination and alternative subjectivities, sexuality studies has never been neutral. This course focuses on the scholarly debates over the practices and politics of sexual knowledges across historical moments, locations, and projects. We will analyze how this knowledge was (and is) produced, what counts as knowledge, who gets recognized as an \"expert\" (and why), and who collects and curates. Our work will especially highlight the dynamic relations between story-telling, assembling, documentation, and interpretation. In doing so, we critically examine the multiple meanings of archives, their origins, and uses. Equally, we problematize the silences and so-called ephemera? Readings will include works on sexuality and bio-politics, classic works in sexology, and ethnographies. The course will also consider film and other media as well as digital archives. Finally, I hope to arrange Zoom conversations with archivists, collections curators and investigators on how they navigate collections as well as how they have assembled their research",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Repairing Historical InjusticesRepairing Historical Injustices  Repairing historical injustices is one of the most debated topics in today's society in many countries on every continent. Restitution (return of confiscated property), reparations (various forms of material compensation for what cannot be returned physically), and apologies (public recognition of wrongdoing and assuming responsibility for it) are perhaps the most widespread transitional justice methods used to amend the massive breaches of human rights perpetrated by colonial empires, dictatorships, authoritarian regimes, and democracies throughout history. Slowly emerging after World War II, the theory and practice of restitution, reparations, and apologies have developed tremendously especially since the 1990s, even though many governments and citizens are still reluctant to accept them. Which were the most well-known and controversial cases of restitution, reparations, and apologies around the globe during the last 75 years and how were they justified, opposed, and implemented? Is the boom of restitution, reparations, and apologies the sign of a new international morality and democratization spreading worldwide? This course investigates these questions by focusing on theories and cases studies of repairing historical injustices perpetrated by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in Europe (against the victims of the Holocaust and the Gulag), by colonial Empires and settler democracies in the Americas, Australia, and Africa (against Native Americans, African Americans, Japanese Americans, Africans, Australian aboriginals, the Maori of New Zeeland, and Indonesians), by the Japanese Imperial Army in World War II Asia (against the victims of sexual slavery, the so-called \"comfort women\"), and by the apartheid regime in South Africa (against black Africans).",

According to the International Organization for Migration's Missing Migrants Project, more than 23,000 people have drowned in the attempt to reach Europe since 2013.The European Union currently spends billions to combat this migration: both to intercept and turn back boats on the high sea, and to pay African states to stop those boats before they ever leave. Humanitarian activists have rescued capsizing boats and brought migrants to shore\u2014at which point they have been arrested as \"smugglers\" for aiding unauthorized migration. While far right parties have exploited tensions over migration, migrants have fought what they see as inhumane policies, with undocumented activists in France, Spain, Italy and beyond demanding the decolonization of European migration policy.This course introduces students to multiple perspectives on migrations across the Mediterranean, with a particular focus on placing current events in historical context. Topics will include the history of colonial, fascist, and post-colonial migrations, the ethics of humanitarian aid, European and African cooperation on regulating migration, and the contemporary activism of undocumented migrants in Europe.",

We will examine the course of \"Western\" historical thinking in particular, with emphasis on the most influential philosophies of history and historical methodologies.  Students will learn the work of the historian, how historians think about history, and how to do scholarly historical work. Throughout the semester, in other words, we will concentrate on the different approaches historians have used to solve the complex problems of interpreting the past and presenting their findings to an audience, and how to apply these approaches to our own work.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Repairing Historical InjusticesRepairing Historical Injustices  Repairing historical injustices is one of the most debated topics in today's society in many countries on every continent. Restitution (return of confiscated property), reparations (various forms of material compensation for what cannot be returned physically), and apologies (public recognition of wrongdoing and assuming responsibility for it) are perhaps the most widespread transitional justice methods used to amend the massive breaches of human rights perpetrated by colonial empires, dictatorships, authoritarian regimes, and democracies throughout history. Slowly emerging after World War II, the theory and practice of restitution, reparations, and apologies have developed tremendously especially since the 1990s, even though many governments and citizens are still reluctant to accept them. Which were the most well-known and controversial cases of restitution, reparations, and apologies around the globe during the last 75 years and how were they justified, opposed, and implemented? Is the boom of restitution, reparations, and apologies the sign of a new international morality and democratization spreading worldwide? This course investigates these questions by focusing on theories and cases studies of repairing historical injustices perpetrated by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in Europe (against the victims of the Holocaust and the Gulag), by colonial Empires and settler democracies in the Americas, Australia, and Africa (against Native Americans, African Americans, Japanese Americans, Africans, Australian aboriginals, the Maori of New Zeeland, and Indonesians), by the Japanese Imperial Army in World War II Asia (against the victims of sexual slavery, the so-called \"comfort women\"), and by the apartheid regime in South Africa (against black Africans).",

To what extent have international legal regimes arisen out of imperial dynamics? Why were slavery and settler colonialism so important to so many constitutional histories? This course takes up these and other questions in order to make sense of the interplay between laws and empires around the world over the last four centuries (circa 1600 to 2000). We will examine: 1) the origins and effects of mixed jurisdictions (or legal pluralism) in different regions; 2) the ways empires have shaped key concepts of sovereignty and citizenship; 3) the role of transnational corporations in bolstering imperial rule; 4) the roots of empire in the history of human rights and global governance; 5) tensions between scientific and legal definitions of race, reality, and indigeneity; 6) Catholic canon and Islamic law; and 7) entanglements between cultural and intellectual property.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: The Jews of Southeastern EuropeStarting in the 19th century, in the Western European colonial and postcolonial imagination, Southeastern Europe (known as the Balkans) became the typical locus of Orientalism at the fringe of Europe, depicted as a place of socio-economic backwardness, bloodthirsty tribalism, and ingrained inter-ethnic and inter-religious hatred and violence targeting especially the minorities, such as the Jews. Such myths worsened during the twentieth century when Southeastern Europe - encompassing the modern states of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Yugoslavia and its successor states - was seen as a source of instability, war, and political chaos and fragmentation. One of the most important minorities of Southeastern Europe during the modern era, the local Jews contributed decisively to the region's economic and socio-cultural modernization, while enduring discrimination, marginalization, long-lasting struggles with integration, and eventually mass destruction and mass emigration. At the same time, during the Ottoman and the Habsburg Empires and the successor nation-states, the region harbored significant traditions of multiculturality, multi-confessionalism, and peaceful coexistence, and some of the local Jews achieved economic prosperity and social and cultural prominence. In spite of the relatively small size of their communities, the local Jews triggered a lot of interest in the Great powers' and local states' political-diplomatic circles who debated their status (often conceptualized as the \"Jewish Question\") at the major peace conferences marking the end of various conflicts such as the 1877-1878 Russian-Ottoman War, World War I, and World War II.During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Jews of the region have witnessed a series of transitions that shaped their lives in a major way - from empires to nation states and emancipation, from war and civil war to peace, from fascism to communism and from the latter to liberal democracy. This course will examine the political, economic, and socio-cultural history of the Jews in Southeastern Europe throughout the 19th and 20th centuries from the disintegration of local empires and the emergence of modern nation-states to the recent democratization and the enlargement of the European Union.",

Using on readings drawn from feminist and queer theory, urban geography, sociology, art history, literature, and social history, we will use these various perspectives to study our main laboratory: nineteenth-century Paris.  Beginning at mid-century, massive engineering projects under Baron Haussmann demolished the twisted winding streets of old Paris to create a modern city of wide boulevards, commerce, and leisure.  A new daily life built around department stores, apartment buildings, the caf\u00e9-concerts, open-air promenades, and parks emerged from these new footprints.  Using three of Emile Zola's novels based on Haussmann's Paris as our common source-base, we will examine how changes in the physical structure altered the old connections between illicit sexualities and nonconforming gender practices and the reproduction of bourgeois gender norms and sexual identities.  In turn, we will ask how the changing economy, with its new opportunities, encouraged new subjectivities that ultimately reshaped both public and intimate spaces, as well as notions of pleasure and criminality. With the guidance of the instructor and using Zola's novels, students will design and compose a short research project (7 pages) reflecting on the themes of the course.",

In light of the continued prevalence of mass displacement, ethnic cleansing, and statelessness throughout the world, we need to move past experiencing each new episode as a sudden, singular and unprecedented \"crisis\" in order to understand the enduring patterns that continue to produce refugees every single day.In this course, students will learn about the kinds of events that have produced mass displacement since the late nineteenth century and the way that \"the refugee\" has consequently been defined in international law, humanitarian action, and public imaginaries. While states have often defined refugees as \"problems\" in need of a \"solution,\" we will also examine how refugee individuals and communities have generated their own politics to challenge their categorization and marginalization.",

Next, we will explore the legal, political, and social forces that led to the American Revolution and the framing and ratification of the United States Constitution, where Americans drew on their legal experiences and called for freedom in powerful but partial ways. We will then examine how judicial and legislative action guided and enabled explosive economic growth in the nineteenth century. Not everyone was able to participate in the new economy, however; we will also explore how law created separate categories for white women, American Indians, and African Americans that limited their participation in law, politics, and society.",

    "ClassOverview": "In 1348 perhaps a third to one half of all Europeans died from a mysterious illness called the Black Death, which was only one of a number of calamities that disrupted normal life.  In the wake of these disasters, thinkers, artists, and a surprising number of common people began to search for explanations for what had gone wrong by asking questions about their own personal identities, about the obligations of a moral life, about the virtues of civic service, and about the their personal relationship with God.  This course explores that search, which is what we now call the Renaissance.  It began among the independent city-states of Italy, particularly Florence and Venice, and spread from them to the rest of Europe.The course will compare developments in Italy with those in northern Europe, especially on the political and family structures of the city-states, the culture of the princely courts, the ambitions of the Roman popes, the social and intellectual basis for artistic creativity, the origins of modern political thought and the scientific method, and the constraints and opportunities available to women.",

Each course stands on its own; you will not be required to take both.) The themes linking both quarters are tensions regarding ethnic and national identity, shifts in gender ideals and family structure, and the effects of imperialist depredation.Modern China was forged by the Qing (1644-1911), the last imperial dynasty. Its achievements and travails continue to inform our present moment. Whether its massive territory, multi-ethnic society, complex economic and political relations with the \"West\" and the rest of Asia\u2014and much more\u2014key facets of contemporary China are rooted in the Qing. Formidable in warfare, the Qing created a multi-ethnic empire bound by Confucian culture, surging domestic and international commerce, and a potent imperial political structure and ideology. At the same time, millenarian and ethnic yearnings, foreign imperialism, and intellectual and political ferment threatened throughout the course of the dynasty to tear the empire apart. Topics to be explored include the Manchu conquest, the imperial state and its problematic relationship with the gentry elite, shifts in gender ideals and family structure, millenarian movements, commercial and industrial growth, intra-Asian connections, the lives of common people, foreign imperialism, US-China relations, early Chinese nationalism and feminism, human and state rights, and revolutionary radicalism.Both classes explore the definition and development of modernity in China. As part of this process, we will question the applicability of the term \"modern\" to Chinese history and consider how the Chinese experience with imperialism has fundamentally shaped their contemporary understanding of their own history.",

    "ClassOverview": "The Japanese city is the main site of Japanese modernity and of its contradictions.  As in many other places with leaders determined to modernize quickly, the prewar Japanese government systematically stripped the countryside of resources in order to build and display the central institutions of a modern nation, most of which were in the cities.  These city-building developments recast Tokyo both as the epitome of Japan's modern success in economic and political terms and also as the site of its cultural and social disintegration.  Then the imperial capital of Tokyo (and nearly all Japanese cities) were virtually leveled during World War II, followed by a decade of poverty and then phenomenal economic growth, when Tokyo became a space for new forms of political and social relationships.  Throughout its history, Tokyo also has been Japan's central site for defining and redefining class and gender identities as well as participating in mass consumption.  The course ends in the early 21st century, when the lived experience of urban life morphed yet again to accommodate the world's fastest aging and shrinking population.  Given that one of the great pleasures of urban life is the amazing varieties of spectacle, visual analysis will be a central element of the course.",

In the second and third parts, we will study the \"archives of terror\" of the Latin American Cold War, and how various forms of orality (i.e. testimonio, life histories, journalistic interviews, and truth commission reports) helped victims of violence to put an end to dictatorships and civil wars, intervene in the peace processes and democratic transitions that followed, and fight for justice, reparation, truth, and reconciliation.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Nature and EmpireThe arrival of European colonizing powers in the Americas in the wake of Columbus's voyages marked a new and often disastrous chapter in global environmental history. American nations and environments shaped the course of European colonial settlement at the same time as colonial expansion profoundly changed the flora, fauna, disease ecology, and patterns of labor and land use prevailing across the Americas. This seminar explores the entangled histories of imperial and environmental history in the colonial Atlantic world. Topics will include the so-called Columbian Exchange and the dispossession of indigenous lands; the transatlantic slave trade and the rise of the plantation system; the intersections of African, European, and Indigenous American agricultural practices; European theories of race and climate; colonial bioprospecting; and the role of disease in the Age of Atlantic Revolutions. We will also consider the imperial origins of modern conservationism and of key environmental concepts such as \u2018wilderness' and 'native' and 'invasive' species.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Sexual Knowledge: Science, Archives, TracesSexuality studies has flourished in recent decades amidst the multiplicities of desires, identities, and bodies. As loci of meaning-making, hierarchical differentiation, and political struggles, as well as the space of transgressive imagination and alternative subjectivities, sexuality studies has never been neutral. This course focuses on the scholarly debates over the practices and politics of sexual knowledges across historical moments, locations, and projects. We will analyze how this knowledge was (and is) produced, what counts as knowledge, who gets recognized as an Aexpert@ (and why), and who collects and curates. Our work will especially highlight the dynamic relations between story-telling, assembling, documentation, and interpretation. In doing so, we critically examine the multiple meanings of archives, their origins, and uses. Equally, we problematize the silences and so-called ephemera.  Readings will include works on sexuality and bio-politics, classic works in sexology, and ethnographies. The course will also consider film and other media as well as digital archives. Finally, I hope to arrange Zoom conversations with archivists, collections curators and investigators on how they navigate collections as well as how they have assembled their research.",

Historians have a broad variety of strategies of investigation, interpretation, and explanation to choose from.  Understanding those strategies requires articulating methods and theoretical perspectives and recognizing the implications when others do so.  The course will orient students in some of the big debates in humanities and social-science scholarship\u2014and their implications--with a specific focus on the contributions that historians are best equipped to make.  This will involve learning read for deep comprehension.  Topics to be considered in the course include: defining fields of history; problems of historical scale, spatiality, empire, and borderlands, the use of certain analytical categories such as social class, race, gender, and other forms of identity, and the implications and impact of organizing principles such as agency and networks.  And, I should also say that, because we only have ten weeks, the course in no way claims to cover all major approaches to History.",

    "ClassOverview": "NOTE: This class is open only to first-year undergraduates selected to be Kaplan Humanities Scholars.Throughout the past five hundred years, islands have witnessed some of humanity's most daring experiments in autonomy and revolution, alongside of some of its most ambitious experiments in domination and administration. Is there something about the nature or scale of islands that tempts such experimentation? One thing seems certain: islands loom large in the imagination. A large body of influential writing, painting, and dreaming about islands has accompanied\u2014and even preceded\u2014encounters with them. In this exciting and experimental course, taught by two award-winning teachers, we will examine islands in both their historical and their imaginary aspects, ranging across a wide variety of novels, plays, movies and historical texts. We'll study islands as utopias, colonies, refuges, social laboratories, revolutionary spaces, objects of \"discovery,\" centers of power, prisons, legal anomalies, and, most recently, harbingers of our environmental fate.Course OutingsYou might not associate Chicago with islands, but the city actually has three (of very different sorts!): Goose Island, Northerly Island, and a neighborhood officially known as \"The Island.\" We will make a class trip to at least one to explore up close how it fits with our course themes. We will also visit the Regenstein Halls of the Pacific (Chicago Field Museum) and attend the Chicago Shakespeare Theater's dazzling new production of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Note: The Kaplan Institute pays for these outings.",

This seminar explores how scientific claims and technological developments help transform cultural understandings of race, gender, and sexuality.

We will take up a series of controversies from the recent past and present to explore the dynamic interplay between expert findings, social identities, and political arguments.",

    "ClassOverview": "Art and the Place of Nature in ModernityHow did we get into this mess? The idea that human beings are separate from something called \"nature\" which they can and should dominate and control is one of the most pervasive ideas in modern Western culture\u2014meaning European and North American culture since the end of the Middle Ages. Over hundreds of years, alongside and intertwining with the development of capitalism and colonialism (for the \"indigenous\" was often placed on the side of nature), Western culture produced artificial divisions between human and nonhuman nature. Artists and scientists alike aspired to equal nature's powers and eventually exploit and \"conquer\" it\u2014or \"her,\" since \"Nature\" has often been gendered female\u2014with the tools of technology. How did this come about? How did nature push back? This course attempts an alternative, ecological history of Western art from the perspective of how art has depicted, defined, constructed, and reckoned with nature. What is nature and the natural? How do nature and art mutually define one another? What does it mean when art rejects nature? Without attempting to be comprehensive, the course will work through carefully selected case studies\u2014some of them student-generated\u2014in landscape, still life, and figure painting; scientific illustration; garden and landscape design; and photography. We will read accessible scholarship and primary texts in art theory and natural science. We will try (and undoubtedly not fully succeed) to come to terms with how this history is reflected in contemporary ecological and epidemiological crises. The course will be taught as a combination of lecture, discussion, and student presentations. It does not require prior knowledge but does hope for your attentive engagement and intellectual curiosity. Written work includes short papers, take-home midterm, and a an 8-10pp final paper.",

How are these institutions enmeshed with broader cultural and political agendas regarding cultural identity and otherness, the formation of artistic canons, and even the concept of ancient art? This course explores modern strategies of collecting, classification, and display of material culture from ancient Egypt, the Middle East, Greece, and Rome, both in Europe and the United States and in their present-day homelands.By analyzing programs of collecting and display, it seeks to understand both the development of modern scholarship in ancient art and the intersection of institutional and scholarly programs. Topics examined include the historical development of modern displays devoted to ancient civilizations in public and private museums, notions of authenticity and identity, issues of cultural heritage and patrimony, temporary and \"blockbuster\" shows, virtual exhibitions and museums, and the archaeological site as a locus of display.",

The poem is both an adventure story and an exhaustive, assessment of the state of politics, society, religion, literature, philosophy, and theology at the beginning of the fourteenth century. This course examines a selection of the Divine Comedy's cantos in their cultural, social and political context. In particular we will explore how the world imagined by the poet relates to late medieval life and culture. A guiding concern of the discussion is to assess the ways in which Dante changed our understanding of the relationship between the human and the divine, justice and love, will and reason, happiness and knowledge, literature and the Bible. Political turmoil, philosophical and theological paradigms social and religious conflict all converge in the making of Comedy and will thus form crucial elements of our investigation.Taught in English.",

This class will investigate how Aeneas' past and Rome's future nevertheless find their way into the Aeneid through two narrative tools: memory and prophecy. As we shall see, memory is faulty, and prophecy is full of half-truths. Without the poet's endorsement of any one version of events, we are left to piece together the story of Rome's rise from Troy's ashes on our own.This course is ideal for students who want to bring their appreciation of the Aeneid to a new level by immersing themselves in the poem and its scholarship. Special attention will be paid to gaining fluency reading Latin and to developing a point of view in current critical debates. For graduate students, additional meetings will be curated around research interests.",

    "ClassOverview": "Global environmental problems, including the looming threat of climate change, the biodiversity crisis, and increasing pressures on ocean ecosystems due to human activities, have become pressing concerns in recent decades. In response, a sophisticated architecture of global governance has emerged, including through the establishment of hundreds of multi-lateral treaties to confront these threats. As a consequence, nation-States have begun to cooperate with each other to an unprecedented extent, although not without facing significant obstacles, and not without domestic political agendas sometimes delaying or thwarting progress at the international level. This class examines the array of legal regimes, politics, governance processes and policy tools that have emerged in the arena of global environmental law and politics. We will focus on a number of different discrete international environmental problems, as well as how international environmental law is formulated and enforced at the international level.Assignments will include drafting of UN resolutions and simulated UN General Assembly \"debates\" and a mid-term examination. There will also be substantial small-group work to engage in interpretation of treaties.",

    "ClassOverview": "When academics discuss communication, they tend to focus on ideal uses of language involving cooperative, honest, helpful, and trustworthy speakers. Real-world communication is not like this at all. This seminar examines communication in our non-ideal world. Our focus will be several forms of deceptive communication: lying, bullshitting, and misleading. We will explore a wide range of topics: what are the linguistic cues to deceptive communication, if any? does lying necessarily involve deception? why is there so much bullshit in contemporary political speech? how is fake news related to lying, misleading, and bullshitting? is fake news a useful notion at all? Our goal will be to figure out what tools and concepts we need to understand the varieties of deception that characterize human language interaction.",

Thus, the main focus of the course is on learning how to do syntax, and secondarily on learning a particular theory of syntax. No textbook will be used, and there will be minimal reading assignments; instead, the course will proceed on the basis of class discussion and weekly written assignments. Although the primary source of linguistic data will be English, examples will also be drawn from other languages both in class and on the assignments.",

    "ClassOverview": "Probability and Stochastic Processes is a three-quarter sequence in probability and stochastic processes requiring background in calculus but not measure theory. The first quarter is a careful introduction to probability spaces, random variables, independence, distributions, and generating functions culminating in the Central Limit Theorem.

    "ClassOverview": "To borrow a phrase from Aristotle, sex is said in many ways. The word \"sex\" can refer to the domain of the erotic, that is, to sexual desire and sexual activity. It can also refer to certain biological categories related to an animal's reproductive role, such as female, male, or intersex. Among humans, \"sex,\" along with the nearby term \"gender,\" can also refer to cultural or social categories like woman, man, or nonbinary. And we can also talk about \"sex\" in the sense of sexual orientation, a set of categories relating an individual's own sex or gender with the sex(es) or gender(s) that the individual is typically attracted to, such as gay, lesbian, straight, or bisexual. Needless to say, things gets complicated pretty quickly.In this seminar, we will read and discuss recent philosophical attempts to make sense of all this. The course will cover a wide range of topics, including: What is sexual desire? What (if anything) is sexual perversion? What is the best account of concepts like gender identity or sexual orientation? How (if at all) do those concepts relate to biological sex? What about the ethics and politics of sex? Is there anything wrong, morally speaking, with casual sex, or with the buying and selling of sex? What should we think about the ways that gender roles and expectations affect people's economic and social prospects? Readings for this course will be drawn mostly from contemporary philosophical sources.",

Some of the questions are: What is democracy? Is it a form of government, a value, an ideal, a political system, a form of life, a bit of all this? Is democracy always the best political solution (in wartime? general starvation?)? Why should the whole of the people decide and not the specialists in the respective questions? Are all democratically taken decisions automatically legitimate (what about minorities\\' rights?)? How should all citizens in a democracy participate in politics? By direct self-government of the people or by voting representatives? Is everything democratically decidable or does the individual have unalterable rights? Is tolerance and/or free speech necessary for democracy and how far can it go?",

To learn a logic is to learn a formal language with its own rules (like a math or programming language), and to develop skill using this formal language. A logic is then used to figure out whether arguments are good or bad in roughly two steps. First, the argument is represented in a logic. Second, the argument is assessed by seeing whether it is constructed in a way where the argument's conclusion follows. Good arguments have conclusions that are guaranteed to be true when the premises are true because of how they are constructed; bad arguments do not. In this course, you will learn two logics: truth-functional logic and first-order logic. Truth-functional logic concerns arguments involving \"and,\" \"or,\" \"if,\" and \"not.\" First-order logic builds on truth-functional logic to concern complex arguments involving \"every\", \"none,\" and \"some.\"",

To learn a logic is to learn a formal language with its own rules (like a math or programming language), and to develop skill using this formal language. A logic is then used to figure out whether arguments are good or bad in roughly two steps. First, the argument is represented in a logic. Second, the argument is assessed by seeing whether it is constructed in a way where the argument's conclusion follows.

Basic to all Pragmatist writers is the belief that the active and interactive human being in its natural and social environment has to stand at the center of reflection. They thus emphasize volitional, procedural, social, and evolutionary aspects of knowledge of any kind. Given this focus on practically involved intelligent agents, political pragmatists like Dewey, Addams, Locke explore the natural origins, revisability and legitimacy of moral and political norms.

What are the different kinds of racial injustice that we can identify, and the different kinds of exclusion, subordination, marginalization and stigmatization that can be part of racial oppression? How should racial oppression be resisted? How should racial violence be stopped? How should we build racial solidarity and fight for racial justice?

We will ask: Are there objective truths about what is valuable - or about anything?  Does life have a point or meaning, or is life absurd? What should one try to get out of life? Are meaning and happiness different goals? How should we think about death?  Is each person the final judge of what is good for that individual, or is it possible to be mistaken about where one's good lies?  What is the relationship between living well and being moral?  How important is pleasure? Since more good is better than less, should we aim at all times to promote \"the greatest happiness of the greatest number\"?",

The war produced a brief natural experiment in what might happen if women were instead allowed full access.  In moral philosophy, the result was the emergence of at least three major thinkers.  Elizabeth Anscombe, Iris Murdoch, and Philippa Foot each carved out distinctive positions, but all defended the objectivity of morality and meaningfulness of claims about value.  Together, they arguably deserve credit for keeping Anglophone ethics alive through a period in which certain orthodoxies of logical positivism threatened to undermine the subject.  Their work on virtue, moral motivation, and goodness, among other themes, has proved more enduring than that of most of their mid-century opponents and is enjoying a resurgence of influence in contemporary moral philosophy.  We will compare and contrast their approaches, both with the going views of their day and with one another.

How did the status of women change in the shift from feudalism to capitalism, and what lessons can be drawn from this history for current political struggles? In what ways are categories such as work, the wage, and the public-private split gendered? We will also explore related issues, such as the debate over the political status of housework, the ethics of commodifying women's reproductive and sexual capacities, the concept of emotional labor, and what it means to provide an intersectional analysis. Readings may include Marx, Engels, Hartmann, Federici, Mies, Davis, Hochschild, and Fraser.",

It is a comparative legal systems seminar, with an international dimension. Given the broad sense that the rule of law is a critical element of good governance, international actors have become rule of law promotors. Is the rule of law something that outsiders can help to create or improve?  Can one create a rule of law if governments or powerful actors refuse to subordinate themselves to the rule of law? How do those actors committed to the rule of law try to balance the aspiration of a rule of law and the political reality that governments and powerful actors have a variety of ways to resist? Participants will be divided into five country groups: South Africa, India, Colombia, China and the United States. All of these countries have constitutions and supreme courts, and all face rule of law challenges. The comparison will allow us to consider the variety of challenges that exist, and the country perspective will help us to consider what, if anything, outside actors can do to support the rule of law.",

These are some of the questions that we will explore in the class \"Studying Campaign 2022.\" The goal of the seminar is to enhance our understanding of the contemporary political environment, how politicians conduct campaigns, how campaigns and media coverage affect voters, and how we study campaign dynamics. We will not only examine the academic literature on these topics, but we also will follow the ongoing events of the 2022 congressional campaigns. Through a combination of group projects (e.g., analyzing campaign websites, a survey), short assignments, and essays, we will learn what makes a campaign effective and to understand campaigns.",

Those factors include: the economics of the business, information biases that come from striving to be \"objective,\" work routines by journalists, and the need to tell a story in a simple fashion so that readers and viewers can easily understand the subject. This course will critically examine assumptions regarding how news is reported, how politicians attempt to manipulate the news and how this impacts the outcome of elections, policies and the perception of political players.",

We will learn about how the U.S. 1980 Refugee Act, a national policy premised on human rights obligations in the 1951 International Convention for the Protection of Refugee and 1967 Protocol structures the admission, reception and placement of refugees in United States, consider the politics of who we admit as refugees in public discourse and study how refugee policy meets the street in neighborhoods and other localities in the United States. We will consider what local understandings of refugee policy can teach us about the meaning of integration as part of broader discourses on constitutional governance, federalism and civil society. Through a case study, we will also look comparatively at the refugee policy of other countries to consider alternative perspectives, policies and ideologies and the interconnectedness of the international refugee protection regime. Through these explorations, students will gain insight into the complexities of refugee policy and, more specifically, asylum and refugee resettlement as a durable solution for refugees seeking protection. Students will gain exposure to discourse and narrative policy analysis, analyze data and have a chance to conduct archival research on localities.",

We investigate how the ways that academics, politicians, and ordinary people have shaped the category of the international as a realm of possibility have generated and sidelined different political projects. With contributions from philosophy, economics, social theory, feminism, cultural studies, political theory, religious studies, and postcolonial studies, we will scrutinize: a) key works that have inspired and articulated theorizations of the international; b) historical contexts and academic debates inscribed in international relations theory; and c) the relationship between theoretical approaches and political practices. Students will be encouraged to explore and develop their perspectives through participation in class discussions, and written assignments (response papers and final paper, no exam).",

    "ClassOverview": "This course focuses on the forces shaping countries' foreign economic policies. Why do governments choose to protect some industries behind high tariff walls while leaving others exposed to the vagaries of international competition? Why do most countries in the world rely on the U.S. dollar for their primary reserve currency - and will the dollar continue to serve that function? Why have many countries removed barriers to cross-border financial flows - and what are the social and political consequences of global financial market openness? Does international trade and investment make military conflict less or more likely? Do economic sanctions even work? How have the series of economic crises over the past decade - the 2008-09 financial market meltdown in the U.S., the global credit crunch the followed, sovereign debt crises (in the Eurozone countries and elsewhere), and the severe, synchronized economic downturns that followed the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic - shifted the distribution of global economic and political power? In this course we will develop an analytical toolkit to provide some insight into these and other questions, paying particular attention to evaluating the theoretical arguments with two types of evidence: qualitative and historical and quantitative and cross-national. The course is organized thematically. We start with an introduction to the study of International Political Economy (IPE) and explore why it is distinct from international economics; following the introduction to the course we will discuss the problem of international cooperation when national economic policies have spillover effects. The next three topics (weeks 2-6) are devoted to three of the main issue areas that concern IPE specialists: the politics of the international trade, monetary, and financial systems. We then turn our attention to economic development strategies pursued by low- and middle-income countries and the role of foreign development aid in promoting growth. The last two weeks of the course are devoted to the relationship between transnational economic linkages and conflict and to the rise of new economic powerhouses (namely, China) and the possible consequences of this shift for American influence in global economic affairs.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course focuses on the forces shaping countries' foreign economic policies. Why do governments choose to protect some industries behind high tariff walls while leaving others exposed to the vagaries of international competition? Why do most countries in the world rely on the U.S. dollar for their primary reserve currency - and will the dollar continue to serve that function? Why have many countries removed barriers to cross-border financial flows - and what are the social and political consequences of global financial market openness? Does international trade and investment make military conflict less or more likely? Do economic sanctions even work? How have the series of economic crises over the past decade - the 2008-09 financial market meltdown in the U.S., the global credit crunch the followed, sovereign debt crises (in the Eurozone countries and elsewhere), and the severe, synchronized economic downturns that followed the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic - shifted the distribution of global economic and political power? In this course we will develop an analytical toolkit to provide some insight into these and other questions, paying particular attention to evaluating the theoretical arguments with two types of evidence: qualitative and historical and quantitative and cross-national. The course is organized thematically. We start with an introduction to the study of International Political Economy (IPE) and explore why it is distinct from international economics; following the introduction to the course we will discuss the problem of international cooperation when national economic policies have spillover effects. The next three topics (weeks 2-6) are devoted to three of the main issue areas that concern IPE specialists: the politics of the international trade, monetary, and financial systems. We then turn our attention to economic development strategies pursued by low- and middle-income countries and the role of foreign development aid in promoting growth.

The last several weeks of the course will provide context for and examine the events leading up to Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which initiated the largest land war in Europe since World War II. As a final project, students will develop policy proposals for how the U.S. and the international community should resolve the most significant geopolitical crisis of the 21st century.",

    "ClassOverview": "How do data savvy experts make quantitative research on political topics readable to the broader public? We'll focus on ways to accurately capture and convey complex topics while unpacking misleading, uninformative, and otherwise unsatisfactory graphs and statistics. This course will broadly focus on two primary components of meaningful research engagement with headline political topics: data literacy and honest, concise description. Over the quarter, students will be exposed to different theories of data science and visualization paired with applied examples of the portrayal of data in popular media. Particularly, we will hash out the dos and don'ts of writing about political or potentially controversial topics for broad audiences, as well as how to dispel misinformation with your own analyses. Students will then learn how to translate these skills into data-informed, public scholarship of their own. Using reputable public opinion data or broadly accessible political science datasets, students will engage with data journalism and author their own public-facing pieces that are in conversation with relevant political headlines\u2014mindful of maintaining rigor while speaking to a diverse audience. An entry level empirical statistics course, such as POLISCI 210 or the statistics department equivalent, are required. Basic familiarity with statistical programming in R is encouraged.",

    "ClassOverview": "It is obvious that dictatorships are ruled by small segments of society. But what about democracies? No matter how democratic, every society is marked by profound inequalities. Not only are wealth, power, and privilege distributed unequally, but they appear to have remained so or are actually getting worse despite the rise of democracy. Theories of oligarchs and elites attempt to make sense of these puzzling patterns and trends. Does democracy really challenge social, political, and economic stratification? Or does \"partial\" equality in the political realm serve to strengthen and legitimize inequalities in other realms of social life? This seminar takes on these important questions from the ancient to the modern era. We will examine a range of cases and countries, with a special emphasis on the US where elite theory arose and oligarchic theory has re-emerged. Students have consistently found this seminar stimulating and relevant to modern political life. This has only increased with the struggle over domination by the 1% (a metaphor for the power of oligarchs and elites).",

The course will focus on the contemporary framework for defining mental illness - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (now in its 5th edition) - with a particular focus on some of the problems that have emerged from the disease-based framework utilized in the manual, and the assumptions that it makes about disorders and typical development. We will explore the role of state mental hospitals in the U.S. in the early to mid-20th century, and we will examine the political forces that drove the de-institutionalization movement of the 1970s and 1980s, with additional consideration of the contemporary implications of the closing of state hospitals. Finally, the course will focus on the evolution of psychotherapy in the modern marketplace, and some of the challenges posed by the demands of the health insurance industry and academic research. The aggressive way in which the DSM has been marketed internationally and the implications of culture for diagnosis will also be discussed. Along the way, we will explore critiques of the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance industry, and modern psychiatry. Some of these themes will also be explored through analysis of popular films and other media. Students will be evaluated on the basis of class attendance and participation, co-leading a class discussion with peers, and writing assignments including short reaction papers and a longer research paper.",

Does the modern woman have the power to \"choose\" her own definition of femininity? What forces help shape girls' understanding of their own sexuality, social roles, and future opportunities? We will read work by psychologists, sociologists, journalists, ethnographers, and other scholars who present divergent points of view on gender roles and feminist psychology.

Ultimately, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill knowledge of the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of a laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have firsthand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must use the paper requirement to satisfy your laboratory credit.",

We will begin at the very beginning of life and learn the biological and environmental influences that help to shape people's personalities over time. We will look at the basic building blocks of temperament and how they these fundamental characteristics of children develop into the major personality characteristics of adults. We will seek to answer questions about what motivates us, how we manage our emotions internally and in social settings, and how we interact as social beings. We will also look at ways in which personality traits may be stable over time or may be susceptible to change. Finally, we will examine the relation between personality and mental health. In what ways do different personality characteristics predispose us to or protect us from the development of psychopathology? What does it mean to have a disordered personality?In this course, we will use both a book that will serve as our primary text and additional required articles that will include research and theoretical articles. Both sources of reading will be critical for understanding this course and (especially information from the book) will not be fully covered in lectures. The research articles may be challenging if you have never read a psychology article before, and I will go over what you need to know and allow time for questions about these articles in class. Class will also cover material that is not explicitly in the readings and will include examples and discussions that will be instrumental to your ability to master the material. If you do not attend class regularly, you should expect that the exams will probably be very challenging for you.",

Relationships? Life challenges? How do people create a sense of meaning in their lives? What types of situations encourage cognitive mastery and creativity? How do we, as a society, encourage connection, compassion and generosity? Students will read a mix of recent scientific journal articles and book chapters, will write discussion questions and take part in team exercises relevant to theory and data pertaining to positive psychology, will journal about their own experiences in trying to apply the findings of positive psychology in weekly well-being exercises, and will design their own positive psychology intervention.

The primary aim is to convey a conceptual understanding, not to memorize formula or to provide rigorous proofs. There will be no matrix algebra, for example. I also want you to get a good idea how these techniques are used and reported in academic research.",

Particular attention is given to theories and research that address the roles of culture, context, human diversity and marginalization. The course adopts an ecological perspective, examining how multiple, intersecting levels of micro and macro contexts (parents, peers, schools, media, culture, stereotypes) shape social and emotional development. Students will submit weekly papers, lead class discussions, and submit a final paper.",

Through careful examination of a variety of literature produced by these traditions, we will consider the ways in which Buddhists have understood human suffering, life after death, karma, merit, the nature of the world and human's place within it, and the path to enlightenment. Our emphasis will be on attempting to understand the moral values, philosophical insights, ritual practices, and social concerns that have shaped Buddhism over centuries of dynamic change in diverse cultural contexts. We will examine not only the history of Buddhism and its three-fold division into Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana, but also facets of the contemporary practice of Buddhism with a focus on the place of mindfulness in America. In addition to textbook readings, course readings privilege primary source readings in order to introduce students directly to the narrative, doctrinal, liturgical, and biographical texts that inform our knowledge of what it has meant to live a Buddhist life over time and across cultures.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Rebellion and Its Enemies in China Today\"The Chinese have achieved enormous economic growth over the last forty years which has dramatically raised living conditions in China.  The Chinese Communist Party has steered this economic development through authoritarian rule which denies the Chinese liberties you take for granted.  Thirty-one years ago, the Communist Party killed Chinese who demanded these liberties by employing the military inside the country.  Since the massacre of 1989, protest in the streets has moved to networking on the internet.  You will write your paper about this challenge to authoritarian rule by engaging some of the following questions: How have urban Chinese lived with the trauma of the massacre?  What exactly happened in 1989?  Making and uploading videos to the internet is a crucial weapon for activists.  How do you evaluate the power of individual videos to force political change?  These videos are documentaries, performance art, interviews, covert recordings of state agents, cries for help of fugitives in real time, and witness testimony.  The creators of these videos are prepared to take risks because they feel there is something wrong with China today.  These feelings are value judgments, or valuations.  How do you tease out the values by which activists judge the state and evaluate their lives in China?  What in turn are the value judgments of American reporters who report on Chinese activism to the American public?  What are the value judgments of American professors who study Chinese activism?  And what are your own value judgments: If it turns out that U.S. capitalism in its combination with democracy cannot economically compete with Chinese capitalism in its combination with authoritarian rule, and you were forced to choose, would you choose capitalism or democracy?  What parts of your life would be impossible under authoritarian rule?  Which line would populism and neo-authoritarianism in America have to cross for you to fight the government?",

The course introduces students to the sociological analysis of gender as a central component of social organization and social inequality in the US context.  We start by reviewing key sociological concepts that are important to the study of gender.  Next, we explore the causes and consequences of gender inequalities in important social institutions such as the family, the education system, and the labor market. We conclude by considering gender inequality in an international comparative context to understand crosscutting similarities and differences between the US and both high- and low-income contexts.

Yet critical work on men and masculinities show us how people of all genders are constrained by gender expectations and assumptions. Furthermore, studies of masculinities shed light on practical questions like, why do men die earlier than women? And, why are men more likely to commit mass shootings? In recent years, the public spotlight has cast light on savory and unsavory aspects of masculinity; think about the rise of the term \"toxic masculinity,\" the #MeToo movement, the 2019 viral Gillette advertisement, and blogs commenting on the behavior of men on the reality show The Bachelorette. In this course, we will go beyond banal statements like \"men are trash\" to critically ask, What role does masculinity play in social life? How is masculinity produced, and are there different ways to be masculine? This course provides students with an intensive introduction to the foundational theory and research in the field of masculinities studies. We will use an intersectional lens to study the ways in which the concept and lived experience of masculinity are shaped by economic, social, cultural, and political forces. As we study the institutions that socialize people into gender, we will examine how the gendered social order influences the way people of all genders perform masculinity as well as the ways men perceive themselves and other men, women, and social situations. Verbally and in writing, students will develop an argument about the way contemporary masculinity is constructed and performed.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Israeli Society and Israeli Sociology\"This course examines the relationship between knowledge production, history, and politics by focusing on the discipline of sociology in Israel. We will begin with a brief introduction in which we will discuss what is sociology, as well as the politics of scientific (i.e., sociological) knowledge production. We will then read and discuss the works of selected authors ranging from Jewish-Zionist proto-sociologists that published their works before the establishment of the State of Israel; to the works of early Israeli sociologists and so-called \"establishment\" sociology; to the later rise of critical approaches. Thoughtfully engaging with these works, we will ask questions such as: What are the main problems with which these thinkers/sociologists grappled and how did they approach them? How did these sociologists conceive of their nation and state? How did they think Israeli society should be compared to other societies? And what, according to these scholars, is Zionism's/Israel's relationship with the Palestinians? As we engage with these questions, students will gain substantive knowledge of Israeli society and develop critical thinking and reading skills.",

    "ClassOverview": "On a daily basis we consume?often without notice or concern?a substantial amount of racial knowledge. We routinely ingest, for example, infographics about demographic trends, media coverage on crime and undocumented immigration, and advertisements for group-specific medicines. In complex and contextually specific ways, this diet shapes our personal and collective identities, social interactions and relationships, and political aspirations and anxieties. In this course, we endeavor to study the politics of racial knowledge?that is, the ways in which categories, measurements, and other techniques of knowledge production have helped to constitute \"race\" as a seemingly objective, natural demarcation among human populations as well as legitimate and, in some cases, contest, forms of racial domination and inequality. Drawing on diverse historical, anthropological, sociological, and philosophical texts, this course explores of the emergence, evolution, and effects of scientific forms of racial knowledge. This exploration will begin by discussing the historical relationship between the modern concept of race and European colonialism and slavery. Subsequently, we will track several major developments in the history of racial knowledge, from Enlightenment philosophy to contemporary genomics research. In these travels we will pose and ponder on the following questions: How have scientists?independently and in conjunction with governments and corporations?conceptualized, measured, and described race? What instruments have been used to demonstrate the so-called objectivity of race and racial hierarchy? How has the human body been made both an object and product of racial knowledge? How have political and intellectual movements and the media advanced or contested the production of essentialist, race-based explanations of human difference? Finally, what role can (and should) racial knowledge play in addressing racial inequality and exclusion in the present?",

Gender is conceptualized as a set of relations, identities and cultural schema, always constituted with other dimensions of power, difference and inequality (e.g., race, class, sexuality, religion, citizenship status). We will analyze the gendered character of citizenship, political participation and representation, social rights and economic rights. We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy and citizenship? How has feminism emerged as a radical challenge to the androcentrism and restricted character of the democratic public sphere? And how has anti-feminism come to be a significant dimension of politics? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include the grassroots democratic activism that gave birth to modern women's movements. We explore how women's political efforts have given rise to the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as reshaping formal politics and policies. And, finally, we will take advantage of the fact that we are in the middle of a Presidential election to examine the gendered aspects of the political landscape in the contemporary United States.The course readings feature different types of materials - original documents, scholarly books and articles, a textbook, policy reports, popular non-fiction work on aspects of gender, policy, politics and society.

There are three main parts of doing fieldwork: observation, participation, and documentation. If you came to sociology because you like being around people, you'll have no problem with the participation part, but might find the documentation and perhaps even the observation a real challenge. If you are the type who loves people but only in the way that life scientists love their lab rats, then you'll be a keen observer and documenter, but will have to force yourself to participate. This course is to try to make all of us more comfortable doing all three. This is a hands-on class. You will be in the field collecting data. We will spend class time discussing your field experiences. The readings will locate field methods within the variety of social scientific methods; raise the logistical, ethical and personal dilemmas you will all face as fieldworkers; and provide examples of how to translate observational data into a coherent and theoretically grounded piece of scholarship.

    "ClassOverview": "The gender division of labor is a key organizing principle in all known societies, but it takes a fascinating array of forms. In industrialized and post-industrial societies, women have increasingly taken up paid employment and moved into formerly-masculine fields, driven by demand for women workers as the economy shifts toward the service sector, and more recently by feminist movements. Yet women are still doing the majority of caring and household labor, while men's take-up of traditionally feminine caring labor has been far more limited. Moreover, the sex segregation of occupations and substantial gendered earnings gaps remain. Meanwhile, much of the work formerly done by housewives has been \"outsourced\" to paid service workers, many of whom migrate from global South to global North to take up this work. Scholars debate about whether and how these arrangements will change, and whether they may be influenced by political initiatives, either top-down (e.g., affirmative action to recruit women to STEM fields) or bottom-up (e.g., cultural and media campaigns to validate new norms). In this course, we will investigate the ways in which work - paid and unpaid, in families and in places of employment - is organized by gender and other forms of power, difference and inequality, such as race, class and migration/citizenship status. We will examine family divisions of labor across diverse households: how do men and women divide domestic work and care for children or others needing care? Where does non-familial provision come into play? What are the consequences for outcomes in paid employment and in terms of the distribution of time, respect, and power? We will learn about the development of the modern economy and occupational sex segregation, as well as how different kinds of men, women and others are treated at work. Finally, we will consider the role of government policy in sustaining or changing these arrangements.",

How do we forge ahead with our dreams if others do not share our values or goals? Cervantes' Don Quixote tackles these big questions in ways that are both moving and funny as it narrates the adventures of the bedraggled hero--a man driven mad by reading too many fantasy novels--and his earthy sidekick Sancho Panza. The novel contains themes that resonate with our lives today, exploring not only what it means to write--and read--fiction but also asking us to evaluate what kind of person we want to be in the world. In our class, we'll read the novel closely and debate how its essential questions can shape our personal choices moving forward.",

    "ClassOverview": "This is an applied regression course. We will discuss statistical estimation and inferential techniques such as least-squares, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests, regarding both the regression parameters and the error variance. We will study the regression models by specifying what the underlying assumptions are, how to check them through diagnostics, and how to build models based on data. Homework will be assigned weekly or biweekly (about 7 assignments). One close-book midterm exam (one double-sided formula sheet is allowed); One open-book final exam/project.",

    "ClassOverview": "The purpose of this course is to provide an elementary introduction to a variety of computational algorithms for the Bayesian analysis of data. Two types of methods are considered in detail: observed data and data augmentation methods. The observed data methods are applied directly to the likelihood or to the posterior distribution. These include: Newton-Raphson, Monte Carlo and Metropolis methods. The data augmentation methods rely on an augmentation of the data which simplifies the likelihood or posterior distribution. These include: EM, Data Augmentation, and the Gibbs sampler. All methods are motivated and illustrated with real examples. Overall, this course provides the student with a good introduction to the field, the ability to read application papers, and the ability to apply these methods to problems of interest to the student. Students understand at a heuristic level how the methods work and when a given method may be preferred over another.",

The second half of the course will cover modern deep reinforcement learning: deep Q learning, policy gradients, monte carlo tree search, inverse reinforcement learning, noise contrastive estimation. We will conclude by discussing some philosophical questions related to artificial intelligence and superhuman intelligence. In particular, we will look at meta-learning and the relationship between memorization and generalization, with input from Heidegger's ideas of temporal abstraction.",

Statistics 420-1 covers distribution theory. Distribution theory is concerned with probability distributions of random variables, particularly those concepts that arise frequently in statistical theory. The emphasis on this course is on the precise and careful statement of results and on the accurate determination of quantities such as moments, distribution functions, and so on, that are often used in statistical methodology. Prerequisites: A good background in calculus, real analysis (e.g., the concept of a limit), linear algebra, elementary probability theory, and statistical methods.",

Generalized linear models are a very broad family of statistical models, loosely described as follows. The response variable has a distribution in an exponential dispersion family and the mean response is related to covariates through a link function and a linear predictor. Generalized linear models allow a unified theory for many of the models used in statistical practice, including normal theory regression and ANOVA models, loglinear models, logit and probit models for binary data and models for gamma responses and survival data.",
