Before 1800, nearly all performances presented exclusively contemporary music, and works more than about fifty years old were considered hopelessly outmoded.

We will navigate the unique topography of Venice to interrogate why musical styles such as monody, polychoral church music, and commercial opera developed and flourished there; how printing and commerce drove musical style and practices; how popular and elite music intersected; and how music interacts with the verbal, architectural, and visual arts. Much of the course focuses on music by Giovanni Gabrieli, Claudio Monteverdi, Barbara Strozzi, and Francesco Cavalli, but it also considers Venetian styles in diaspora in the works of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz (Saxony), Marcin Mielczewski (Poland), Juan Guti\u00e9rrez de Padilla (Mexico), and others. Students will tackle articles from scholarly journals, monographs, and primary sources; engage the concept of baroque within the frame of cultural studies; and debate the social functions of vocal music. We will also look at selected seventeenth-century repertoires un-related to Venice in order for students to feel confident with their understanding of the period in general.The course is aimed at students with some previous background in baroque music and will be conducted as a mixture of lectures, discussion, and student research presentations. Italian and/or Latin language skills are useful but not required.",

We will consider original musical works in score and recorded formats, and the processes surrounding ways in which they've been modified over time for different performers, performances, and audiences as well as presented as the original creators knew them. Each student will create an original edition of a chosen work or linked set of works, using editorial methods covered in the course, and we will consider histories and purposes of notation and other technologies for presenting music; composition students may develop original notation if they so choose. Scholarly material and methodologies will be drawn from all fields of musical inquiry, from critical theory, from textual histories and cultures, and from the digital humanities. If conditions permit, we will visit the University Archives and Newberry Library to look at original, unedited music and to consider historical recording and playback technologies.",

    "ClassOverview": "The essential aim of the three-quarter orchestration sequence is to develop a practical familiarity with all of the standard orchestral instruments (and perhaps a sampling of the non-standard ones...). Topics to be addressed during the sequence will include: families of instruments, individual ranges and transpositions, idiomatic technical considerations, timbral parameters and their relationship to dynamics, transcription techniques, spatialization, texture, and extended techniques. Orchestration will be approached from a variety of perspectives: practical, historical, and structural.Although each quarter will be taught by a different member of the composition faculty, the courses are intended to be taken in sequence. Therefore 314-1 is a prerequisite to taking 314-2, and both are prerequisites to taking 314-3 in the spring.During the first quarter, we will focus primarily on the characteristics of solo instruments belonging to one or another instrumental choir. Combinations of instrumental forces will follow later in the sequence, in winter and spring quarters. Coursework will take the form of readings from the text, critical listening, score study/analysis, writing projects, and short quizzes. These quizzes will pertain to subjects such as notational issues, instrumental ranges, definition of terms (Italian, French, German, English), transposition, et cetera. Sometimes they will be announced ahead of time. In addition to the textbook, you will need a reliable means of notation, parameters of which will be discussed at the outset of the course.",

Born from the spirit of Romanticism, it epitomizes the aesthetics of this artistic movement by its deep bond between music and poetry and intimate collaboration of voice and accompaniment. In this course we will trace the development of German Romantic song from its origins in Schubert, through its further development by Schumann and Brahms, until its late incarnations in orchestral songs by Mahler and Richard Strauss. Underway, we will learn the German poets whose texts were most frequently set to music (Goethe, M\u00fcller, Heine, Eichendorff, R\u00fcckert), explore issues of poetic rhythm, meter, and versification, and investigate their relation to musical rhythm, meter and form. We will excavate meaning and expression of individual songs as it emerges from the interaction between music and poetry and from interrelation of individual songs within song cycles.The course will be of interest for students of music theory, musicology as well as vocal and instrumental performance.",

    "ClassOverview": "German Romantic song (Lied) takes a special place in the repertoire of Western art music. Born from the spirit of Romanticism, it epitomizes the aesthetics of this artistic movement by its deep bond between music and poetry and intimate collaboration of voice and accompaniment. In this course we will trace the development of German Romantic song from its origins in Schubert, through its further development by Schumann and Brahms, until its late incarnations in orchestral songs by Mahler and Richard Strauss. Underway, we will learn the German poets whose texts were most frequently set to music (Goethe, M\u00fcller, Heine, Eichendorff, R\u00fcckert), explore issues of poetic rhythm, meter, and versification, and investigate their relation to musical rhythm, meter and form. We will excavate meaning and expression of individual songs as it emerges from the interaction between music and poetry and from interrelation of individual songs within song cycles.The course will be of interest for students of music theory, musicology as well as vocal and instrumental performance.",

The primary theoretical frameworks will be those proposed by Daniel Harrison and Fred Lerdahl.    The class will fulfill both the DM writing requirement for students who need classes of that kind in their curriculum, and the theory examination waiver requirement.",

    "ClassOverview": "Expectation is an aspect of listening experience that has attracted lots of attention from music theorists since the second half of the twentieth century. After the pioneering work of Leonard B. Meyer and his students, Eugene Narmour and Robert O. Gjerdingen, further research of musical expectation was undertaken by scholars working in the field of cognitive study of music, generating an ever-growing number of influential publications. In this seminar we will reconstruct this stream of research from its dawn until today and try to assess its prospects. To this end, we will retrace the questions that have been asked by earlier authors and appraise the answers that have been given. The questions will include: What is expectation? How does it arise? How does it inform musical meaning and emotion? What musical parameters does it concern? Is it determined by structure of these parameters? Or is it a matter of statistics? What types of knowledge does it engage? How does it relate to consciousness and memory?",

Topics that are expected to be covered include the demand for risk capital, the various types of financing available to start-up companies, the most common structures used in these deals, the process by which a financing round is negotiated and consummated, best practices for founders in making an initial pitch to a potential venture capital investor, a survey of the the material terms contained within venture capital term sheets and the principal investment documents (including the ways in which these terms are being negotiated between founders and investors in the current market), exits and initial public offerings in venture capital-backed businesses, a review of certain portions of typical venture capital financing documentation (including preferred stock purchase agreements, certificates of incorporation, investors' rights agreements, right of first refusal and co-sale agreements and voting agreements), and financing closings.  We will also regularly discuss current trends within and related to the venture capital space.  Relevant legal considerations will be examined, but the emphasis will be on the practical and market considerations involved in these deals.",

Thus, discussion in this course is designed to help stimulate a better entrepreneurial imagination and sympathy.3.\tA secondary objective of the course is to increase the student's facility with law and economics generally so that students can deploy this method in other areas of law.

This course aims to develop that skillset. Grades will be based on class participation at 40%, final exam at 40%, and in-class presentations at 20%.This course has four learning objectives. Learning objective 1 is to develop an advanced understanding of statutory interpretation. We will examine sweeping theories like purposivism and textualism, interpretive canons like plain meaning and constitutional avoidance, and other aspects of statutory interpretation as a field. Students will join the great debates that fascinate and divide lawyers and judges today. Learning objective 2 is to develop the ability to wield interpretive theory in legal argument. Students will practice crafting arguments from purposivist, textualist, and other standpoints, learning not just the theory of statutory interpretation but the practice as well. Learning objective 3 is to understand how legislation functions in the overall structure of American democracy. Democratic countries make law chiefly through representatives of the people assembled in legislatures; that is the ideal, anyway. Is it the reality? This course will ask fundamental questions about whether the process of making, interpreting, and enforcing legislation in contemporary America corresponds to democratic ideals. Learning objective 4 is to practice engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with ideas opposed to one's own. This course will cover a wide array of ideas, some politically inflected, and it is crucial to the teaching and learning experience that everyone bring a spirit of debate, curiosity about different perspectives, and respect for one another to class discussion.",

In addition to the weekly seminar, students work 12 to 15 hours a week in approved externships for federal and select state court judges. Students maintain reflective journals analyzing their field placement experiences and class topics and responding to questions about their externship.  The class offers students opportunities to improve a variety of skills used by lawyers, including research, analysis, writing, listening, and presentation.  Students secure their own externships with the assistance of the professor.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course gives students an opportunity to ask some of the big questions about law, about politics, and about one's own life in the law. Unit I is about four influential theories of law: legal positivism, natural law, legal realism, and critical legal studies. Unit II is about the nature of democracy. We will examine theories of what democracy is and ask whether contemporary democratic countries live up to democratic ideals. Unit III is about one's own life in the law. We will examine whether the adversarial system does more harm than good and how a lawyer's life can be a life worth living. The three units thus focus, respectively, on legal philosophy, political philosophy, and ethical philosophy, as philosophers use those terms, and the course is indeed highly philosophical. Yet the course is designed so that students do not need prior training in philosophy to take it; the reading material and class discussion are designed to speak to all.What is necessary is a taste for theoretical thinking (this is not a black-letter law course) and an active desire to engage with ideas different from one's own (an open, debating structure in which students are called upon to consider and even voice arguments with which they personally disagree is part of the structure of the course).",

Studies on learning show that people do not learn by watching other people research, listening to people talk about research, or reading about research.  You can only learn to research by practicing!  Luckily, most of that practice takes place in class.  If you attend class and give the in-class exercises your best effort, you'll be half of the way to success.  The other half comes from learning from the feedback that you'll receive.  I will give you a lot of feedback on your outside of class assignments.  You will also get a rubric that will tell you what I'm looking for.  As you learn from the feedback and from your experiences in class, you will find yourself becoming a more efficient and confident researcher!",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar will attempt to answer a perennial question - How can a good lawyer be a good person? - through an examination of attorney memoirs.  We often study legal ethics through the use of hypothetical problems that are intended to raise vexing issues for practicing lawyers.  Even in sophisticated simulations (such as those used at Northwestern), however, it is nearly impossible to duplicate the exigencies, pressures, and conflicting demands experienced by contemporary lawyers.  Studies of the legal profession are also often one step removed (at least) from actual law practice, based on surveys or aggregations of information that do not address the actions of individuals.Lawyer (and judge) memoirs may be the means to bridge this gap, providing an opportunity to explore the ways in which individuals assume roles, make compromises, and seek solutions to daily problems in law firms and in courts.  Of course, most memoirs are self-serving (when they are not self-aggrandizing), so they will have to be read with much skepticism.  But that will be revealing as well, as we will be able to consider the most common rationalizations that are used to excuse -- and sometimes glorify -- questionable choices and conduct.Some memoirists are painfully introspective, some appear to be blinded by ego, and others are surprisingly na?ve.  In combination, I believe this literature can be the basis for some true insights into the way law is, and should be, practiced.",

    "ClassOverview": "TEACHING METHODA.\tThe Simulated CourtroomThis course is taught in the simulated courtroom method.  Each week you will be assigned to perform as trial counsel in one or more advocacy problems.  For the most part these problems will consist of direct and cross examinations.  The witnesses may be played by members of the faculty, but frequently you will be called upon to play the witness (especially in those problems for which you have been assigned a direct examination).Each student will be designated an A or a B for the purposes of the assignments.  Unless you are instructed otherwise, please prepare each assignment according to your A or B designation.  You will retain your designation for the entire semester. At the beginning of each class session court will convene.  From that point onward you are expected to act in the role of trial counsel at all times other than during critique or discussion.B.\tThe All Object RuleThe law of evidence is a crucial aspect of every trial, and it is essential that you learn both to make and to respond to evidentiary objections.  Accordingly, all students and instructors may make objections at any time during any problem session.  To raise an objection you must stand and state your legal grounds.C.\tCritiqueAt various times during each class session the student performances will be critiqued by the faculty.  The purpose of critique is to help you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your own performance, with an eye toward future improvement.  Our goal in critique is not to criticize you either as an advocate or a person, but rather to alert you to any mistakes and to make specific and forward-looking suggestions.Please be aware that on a faculty of over 50 trial lawyers there are bound to be diverging points of view -- not to mention outright disputes -- as to how any particular exercise ought to be approached.  Do not be frustrated when you receive contradictory advice from different instructors.  The first step in your own development as a trial lawyer is to analyze such contrasting information and to determine which approach is best for you.",

Negotiation and communication for the purpose of persuasion are also a major element of everyday life.  This course is designed to give students experience in negotiation, as well as a grounding in negotiation theory.  The emphasis of the course is on experiential learning.  Students spend most of their time participating in negotiation simulations, as well as discussing negotiation problems.  Students are observed in their negotiations and receive feedback.  Several negotiations are recorded for later viewing and feedback.The negotiation simulations cover a wide range of situations.  In past years, students have negotiated the settlement of lawsuits, neighborhood disputes, campus disputes, personal services contracts, contracts for the sale and purchase of commercial and residential property, intra-family disputes, corporate takeovers, international disputes, and labor disputes.This is an experiential learning class that provides opportunities to develop negotiation skills through simulations, pre-negotiation analysis, reflection, and other activities. There are weekly assignments that are designed to explore negotiation concepts and strategies. At the end of the semester, students practice their negotiation skills through working with classmates on a final group project.",

Students must take this course to be eligible to take the Professor Cohn's Mediation Practicum in the spring. Students who take the practicum will mediate disputes in the Cook County court system through the Center for Conflict Resolution (CCR).Northwestern has partnered with CCR to provide professional mediation skills training during the course of the semester.  CCR is one of the nation's largest and longest running community mediation centers.  It provides extensive mediation services in Chicago through the Cook County court system and community-based referrals (www.ccrchicago.org).  As part of this professional training, all students must attend a mandatory weekend training session on September 18, 2021.Students certified as CCR mediators will be eligible to conduct actual mediations on behalf of CCR in the 4 credit hour mediation practicum during the Spring semester (LITARB 676).  Certification as a CCR mediator is determined by a committee of CCR trainers and is based on a student's ability to successfully complete a series of simulated mediations and demonstrate mastery of CCR's mediation model.  Students interested in pursuing certification must attend the additional training session taking place September 19, September 25, October 2, 2021.In addition to the training held by CCR, students pursuing certification may be required to do other activities and simulations inside and outside of class in order to meet certification requirements. Students are expected to make all reasonable efforts, including but not limited to, finding role players, participating in simulations and role plays, and completing suggested exercises, in order to meet the certification standard by November 15.  Because certification by CCR is a prerequisite to enroll in the Mediation Practicum course, a student must be certified before the end of the fall semester or they will not be eligible to enroll in the spring Mediation Practicum.Once students complete the practicum, they may maintain their certification by continuing to mediate at CCR once a month.",

    "ClassOverview": "In this course, we will explore the roles lawyers and other stakeholders play as advocates for social, political, and civic change. Students in this class will engage in real-life and class-based learning. During the semester, students will work with non-lawyers at a community-based or change-oriented organization. Change-oriented means any organization working actively to move the needle on a particular issue or set of issues. Students are free to select an organization that aligns with their interests, but the organization needs to be approved by the professor, so reach out to her as soon as possible. The professor is also willing to help you find an organization that would specifically interest you or allow you to select an organization in need of help that she has available. You should begin looking for an organization prior to the start of the semester, since you should have the organization finalized by the first week of class.Through this course, students will engage in discussions on real-life issues impacting different communities and will have the opportunity to speak with community leaders and advocates who are working to create change in their own communities. Topics to be covered in this course include: organizing and different theories of change, the tools and strategies of lawyers working for change, the history of lawyers working with different movements and communities, and how race, class, and power affect particular movements and your work. There are also weeks when we discuss whatever topics students suggest. Class discussion will be based on the assignments, student suggested topics, and your experiences at your community-based or change-oriented organizations. Guest speakers will join us throughout the semester. In the past, they have included communications experts, organizers, nonprofit leaders, and lawyers working for change.The final grade will be based approximately on the following three components:(1) Final Project with 40 Volunteer Hour Requirement (60%): While working with a community-based or change-oriented organization, students will develop and complete a final project that will support their organization in their efforts to create change. The final project may consist of one deliverable or a set of deliverables that the organization would find useful in their efforts to advance change. A substantive part of the deliverable(s) will be in writing, but there is no specific page requirement because the length may depend on your organization's needs.The deliverable(s) can take a variety of forms and combinations, and the professor is happy to discuss possibilities and confirm whether any tentative project will meet the course criteria. Some examples of different parts of prior student deliverables are: strategizing with community members and different stakeholders on how to identify and resolve particular issues, crafting the message of a campaign, doing issue research, reviewing and analyzing pending legislation, attending legislative sessions, writing press releases or different types of articles, surveying and interviewing community members and different stakeholders, preparing a report on pertinent issues, creating fact sheets and manuals, planning events, and conducting know your rights presentations for particular communities.Throughout the semester, students will have small assignments (e.g., final project proposal, outline, and first draft) that will be possibly graded on completion, in order to check-in on the progress of the final project. Additionally, students will participate in Peer Feedback Workshops, which involve students presenting an overview of their final project and work with their organization to the class. The Peer Feedback Workshops will be an opportunity for classmates to ask questions, share solutions, and learn from each other regarding the issues that each student is working on during the semester.Students will work with non-lawyers at their community-based or change-oriented organization for a minimum of 40 volunteer hours during the semester. Students will keep track of the hours they have spent assisting their organization and provide a brief, general description of how they spent their time. They will submit their time log with their final project assignments throughout the semester. All time spent toward the creation of the deliverable(s) and working with the organization in any other way (e.g., attending meetings) will count towards fulfilling the students' 40 volunteer hour requirement. The 40 volunteer hour requirement is not a separate component from the final project.(2) Class Attendance and Participation (30%): Every week students will have assignments relating to the course topics. Weekly assignments may include preparing the graded assignments, doing short readings, watching relevant videos, writing down your goals for the semester, or finding a moving message for a campaign. At times, this content will be provided by the guest speakers. Students are expected to come prepared to speak about the assigned materials for the week and to share their experiences working with their organizations.(3) Short Reflection Paper (10%): In addition, students will be assigned one short reflection paper, and students can select from a multitude of prompts to reflect upon their work with their organization relative to different themes examined in this course.If you have questions about any aspect of the course, please contact the professor by email: m-llorente@law.northwestern.edu. The professor is willing and eager to answer any questions about the course, and she is interested in your feedback and suggestions.",

Working with an Ethiopian NGO and a number of U.S. and Canadian partner NGOs, we'll be continuing advocacy efforts on behalf of an indigenous Guji community that is suffering devastating effects due to toxic contamination (mercury, arsenic, etc.) from the Lega Dembi gold mine.  Details of what we'll do depend on evolving circumstances, but we may write submissions to UN human rights mechanisms, continue our efforts to force the government to make public the results of impact assessments, seek to utilize European laws and regulations with respect to the supply chain obligations of the Swiss refinery that has purchased the gold from this mine, and explore possibilities within the African HR system.2.  We have been asked by two women's rights NGOs in Myanmar to analyze the results of a survey questionnaire on the security situation of women in Myanmar following the military coup, to write a report based on these results, and to engage in international advocacy using the report.  Please understand that this project may be canceled or delayed if either the security situation or the pandemic make it impossible for our NGO partners to proceed at this time; I am hopeful, though, that we will be able to move forward on this.3.  Working with the newly-founded Geneva-based International Platform for Corporate Liability, we will continue work begun last year to research whether grounds exist to hold corporate actors in the gold and diamond sectors criminally liable for complicity in crimes against humanity in the Central African Republic.4. With luck, we may be able to resume clinic travel this fall.  I am hopeful that some of us will be able to attend the UN Forum on Business & HR in November, and there is a small possibility we may be able to return to Addis Ababa to continue our work with our colleagues in Ethiopia.  Of course, this will be dependent on the pandemic situation.5.  We may add another project - perhaps in collaboration with a legal clinic in either Arequipa, Peru, or Tbilisi, Georgia, or in collaboration with an LGBTQ+ NGO in Sri Lanka that my clinic has worked with in the past.6. Do you have an idea of a HR project you would really like to work on?  I am always open to student suggestions for projects that are suitable for this clinic, though whether we can proceed with an idea this coming semester depends on time demands of all projects.",

The second quarter focuses on project implementation and ongoing professional communication.In the DSGN 384-1,2 course sequence, students work in teams on interdisciplinary projects in a learn-by-doing format. Each team works on one project across both quarters, for 20 weeks. The first quarter emphasizes project research, iterative concept development and prototyping, and professional communication, and it includes lectures on advanced topics in design. The quarter culminates in a conceptual design and a design review. The second quarter focuses on project implementation supported by iterative prototyping, testing, and analysis, as well as continued professional communication. The projects focus on the technical side of design. While users are still a consideration, they are not the primary focus as in the DTC or DTD courses. Students are expected to apply the discipline-specific knowledge from their upper-level courses.",

Most engineers work on some sort of product development, whether it be creating new products or making better products, all based on a fairly well-defined design process. In ME 398, student teams create a new product for an outside client using this design process. Undergraduates take this course in their fourth year, after having mastered many of the engineering tools that they will use in their careers. Mechanical engineering students are required to take either this course or ME 340-2 to fulfill their design requirement.

Because they usually exhibit remarkable physical properties, in general superior to the properties of their individual components, they appear pervasively in engineering applications (e.g., reinforced concrete in construction, fiber-reinforced materials for aircraft structures, reinforced rubber in car tires, ?). Despite being comprised multiple material phases with different physical properties, these materials may be considered for practical purposes as homogeneous materials with physical material-like effective properties.The course will focus primarily on the elastic properties of a wide range of composites (laminated materials, particulate/fiber-reinforced composites, multidirectional laminates) and will cover a number of engineering methods for the computation of the effective properties of these materials based on the properties and spatial arrangement (volume fraction, shape, orientation, ?) of their underlying constituents.Course Outline:I.

The goal of the course is to give students the capability to lead the evolution of digital marketing practices in their organizations through an understanding of the collection and application of data to solve marketing problems. Students will have exposure to an array of the most current digital analytics tools, and will conduct exercises and engage in discussions that illustrate how data and analytics should ideally shape marketing planning, content strategy, digital design and marketing performance evaluation. The course will cover the collection of data from web, email, social, mobile and paid display media through tagging, testing and survey, and will explore the marketing and business application of this data for performance evaluation, communications planning, design and content development & targeting. The application of marketing analytics in the overall emerging big data structures in organizations will be explored. The progression toward increasing capabilities for real-time 1:1 marketing through algorithmic targeting and content personalization will also be discussed in this context, as will the ever changing privacy landscape and questions around who owns consumers' digital data.",

You will be able to do this whether you work in an Advertising Agency, PR Agency, consulting firm or a complex organization. The tools are robust and apply to a variety of different settings. More specifically, managing integration involves organizing and effectively implementing a broad range of IMC activities that are internal to an organization and at the same time aligning these activities with external vendors, customers and third parties. If this seems complex - it is!

    "ClassOverview": "Narrative Structure in Storytelling is an immersive discussion-based course about the art of crafting stories for different media platforms with a pivot toward personal narrative creation in the second half of the quarter. Students will spend time reading, watching and listening to great journalism. They will deconstruct, analyze, tear apart and re-shape stories in an effort to understand how good stories come to be. Each week the course will focus on a different medium, from narrative writing, to documentary film, to podcasts, to advertising messages to identify the core components of storytelling and how each medium uses them well (think characters, leads, arc, plot, audio, etc.). Students will look at what all stories have in common as well as how mediums differ along with core tenets and when to break the rules. Students will gain a strong understanding of how to take a large body of information, organize it and then create meaningful, gripping narratives across mediums. Guest speakers may include NPR reporters, documentary filmmakers, digital editors, advertising creatives and long-form writers. Assignments include reading, watching and listening to the year's best works, weekly story analyses, writing short narratives and possibly editing and reimagining stories across mediums. In the second half of the quarter, we will focus on reading, writing and producing personal narratives. Students will create a short audio narrative and a personal essay. No audio experience necessary.",

    "ClassOverview": "Ideally, in a democratic society, we have a government of, by and for the people. And the consent of the governed regarding public policy and policymakers is informed by a free and responsible press. But what happens when this process is distorted by a disinformation campaign set in motion by government elites who attempt to engineer public consent? What is the role of the news media in reporting the news, assessing it, critiquing it, contextualizing it in contributing to enlightened public decision making?  How might the conventions of journalism?the traditional rules and practices that guide our work?be used against the objectives of journalism? Through assigned readings and robust discussion, this seminar will explore the dynamics of public opinion and attempts to manipulate it. Against the backdrop of media coverage of current events, we will come to understand the framework for propaganda, its elements, how it works and how it has been used in the construction and reinforcement of social difference. Ultimately, we will see how this process has been weaponized?pitting identifiable groups against each other?in the process of assuming and maintaining political power. In this process, we will see how the term fake news has been used in an effort to undermine media credibility and cause public confusion about what to believe.  Ironically, and unsurprisingly, we will see that the very people charging fake news are the ones generating it. In the end, we must consider our role as journalists in this process.  How have we been complicit?  What is our responsibility to ensure a deeper public appreciation of the value of social difference? What is the public responsibility in achieving a degree of literacy, particularly with increasing reliance on social media? These are vital questions as we find ourselves on the cusp of a new demographic reality, a new democratic reality, a truly plural society.",

It's designed to provide an overview of the domain for graduate students who aim to report on, write for, edit in, or curate for magazines broadly defined (print, online, or both). The course is intended as a magazine-inflected complement to the other major course of the term -- reporting and revising in your project-based learning class during the first quarter.Our work together is primarily based on reading, viewing, and analysis of major magazine titles - legacy as well as newcomers - to explore the fundamental qualities of strong narratives. No matter what role you envision for yourself in media, our work will be relevant. Is it your ambition to create new knowledge through writing journalistic pieces for existing outlets? Or to edit, curate, produce, or otherwise serve as a team leader on investigative projects? Or to become an entrepreneur launching something brand new?This is the place to consider the heart of the matter - the power of diverse story forms for different purposes - and to deepen your understanding of them as you prepare yourself for a year-long exploration of your own talents. Every person involved in the creation of meaningful journalism, after all, should be literate in key elements of compelling journalism.The course is designed, in particular, for students who will move in the next three quarters of study to magazine presentation, digital media, magazine editing, and feature writing. For students who intend to finish up in the Narrative Capstone, here's the first step on that pathway.Each week we'll sink deeply into the editorial architecture of a particular magazine outlet. We'll regularly hear directly from writers and editors, in person and via Zoom or Skype. We'll build towards a broad view of what's currently happening in the domain, helping each student clarify where s/he would like to put her effort during the year.The overarching idea is to reveal varied approaches to immersion reporting, story framing, and sustained narrative.",

Thankfully, this is quickly changing and these sequential art forms are beginning to be taken seriously as cultural objects. However, as is often the case with emerging art, graphic novels and comics from the Europe and the United States dominate conversations, despite the presence of quality graphic work from the Global South. With particular consideration to how comics from African and the Middle East subvert images of Africa and the Middle East produced elsewhere, this course supplements area-focused readings with secondary materials, most notably the work of Scott McCloud, to train students to perform formal readings that account for the mixed visual/written forms of these works.",

Each week you will focus on one type of source and, with the aid of theoretical guides, discover how they can help you build historical interpretations. The sources will come from all over the world, including the Middle East, and cover the last 500 years. Our goal is to understand how different kinds of sources contribute to our historical understanding in different ways. We will start by reading written sources, such as diaries or newspapers, before looking at visual sources, such as portraits or cartoons, and finally study physical sources, such as clothes or architecture. By the end of the course, you will have a strong understanding of how to include a wide variety of primary sources to support analytical arguments about the past. Effective use of evidence is key skill for anyone interested in taking further history courses and for your undergraduate education in general.",

    "ClassOverview": "At Northwestern, we ask students to take liberal arts courses. There is an inherent belief that these courses lead us to better know the world around us. In this Ways of Knowing course, we will unpack the notion of a liberal education and its quintessential space, the university. We will critically examine the very idea of knowledge: What makes the knowledge you acquire here valuable? Which kinds of knowledge are considered to be significant and authoritative in the societies we live in, and why? How is this knowledge produced, for what purposes, and with what social effects? What are the entanglements between knowledge and power? Who has the authority to produce it, who do we count as an authoritative knower on an issue, and why? What makes this knowledge valuable to you and how does it serve the goals you came to pursue? The goal of this class is to encourage and enable you to critically reflect on the conditions of your learning and the purposes for which you are pursuing it. More specifically, you will learn about colonial knowledge production and its manifestations in the contemporary world. Thus, we will look at education in our postcolonial context, where there is nothing really post about colonialism. We will examine how dominant forms of knowledge production have been and continue to be shaped and influenced by colonialism. To do this, we will explore the history of colonial knowledge production, specifically focusing on the idea of the human as a primary way of understanding our world. Throughout the semester, we will explore topics of education, power, knowledge production, colonialism and humanity through the lens of philosophy, anthropology, history and literature, but also thinking of these various modes of knowledge production as intersecting with and informing each other. Our goal is to get you to think critically about different ways of understanding the world. We also want you to think about how we have gotten to where we are, as well as to equip you with tools for critiquing the world around you, especially your own university - your second home for the next two years.",

The goals of the course are (1) to acquaint students with a vocabulary specific to film and other moving-image media; (2) to provide students with the critical tools required for analysis of the moving image; and (3) to develop student skills in writing and argument for humanistic inquiry. By the end of the course, students will be able to: (1) identify the elements of the moving image (e.g., kinds of camera movement) and of the soundtrack according to a standard glossary of technical terms; (2) describe patterns of similarity, repetition, difference, and variation in the image and sound tracks; (3) propose connections between those patterns and narrative structure, character psychology, or larger themes and ideas; and (4) explain those connections in a written argument about how patterns in the most salient visual and/or aural elements of a film or program help us to understand its structure, characters, or themes.",

    "ClassOverview": "Although media made for girls has long been derided as silly and undeserving of close attention, to the millions of preteen and teen girls who consume it, it is anything but insignificant. From novels and movies in the 1930s featuring teen sleuth Nancy Drew to contemporary films and TV shows such as Whip It, Wadjda, and That's So Raven, girls' media artifacts have functioned as important historical sites for the negotiation of cultural politics and youthful feminine ideals. In order to shed light on the often-overlooked history of girls' media, this course offers a critical investigation of (primarily) U.S. girls' media from the 1930s to the present, including novels, films, TV shows, advertisements, music videos, teen magazines, toys, and new media. We will investigate girls' media artifacts as aesthetic, political, and commercial texts through which youth have interfaced with lessons about gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, national identity, and generation at different historical moments. Although American commercial media will be taken up as our main object of study, students will have opportunities to explore media made outside the U.S. in their own research projects, and we will consider girls' independent production and reception practices in both Western and non-Western contexts. Ultimately, the goals of the course are: 1) to explore the dominant strategies utilized by the media industries to represent female youth and their concerns, as well as those utilized by girls in practices of self-representation; 2) to examine girls' reception of and diverse engagements with media; and 3) to consider how the landscape of girls' media production and consumption has changed, and resisted change, over time.",

While often subtle, skillfully produced sound design immerses the viewer, listener, or product end-user, shaping the emotional landscape of the piece and guiding the audience along. It's an observable phenomenon that people can watch and even enjoy a scratchy, jumpy, low-quality image, (e.g. The Blair Witch Project (1999)), but they cannot bear poorly produced audio. Therefore, artfully crafted sound design is a vital component of effective audio-visual media. This course explores the history of sound design, its theoretical underpinnings, and the core features of a compelling soundscape. We will explore the workflow of a professionally produced soundtrack?including capturing, editing, repairing, mixing, and applying effects. Students will breakdown and analyze soundscapes by listening to examples from different periods and media formats, produced via a variety of methods, (both analog and digital). Students will examine the state of the art and potential futures of sound design, discussing the core concepts of immersive and 3D audio. Finally, students will apply the knowledge and skills developed in the class to produce original sound design projects to strengthen their portfolios, win awards, and attract real-world clients.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course serves as an introduction to archetypal structure of stories by examining how a mythopoeic framework may be found in various narratives of film and literature from across time and culture. Why are some stories timeless? How do some stories have global appeal? Joseph Campbell coined the term monomyth to describe a single journey universally travelled in an epic pursuit of heroism, arguing that there are fundamental story elements that engages every person's psychological and metaphysical needs. This course takes a fresh look at those elements with a special focus on the inner drives of the hero's and heroine's journeys, understanding that the former is a journey through the first half of life while the latter is a journey through the second. With a critical review of archetypal theories, the monomyth can be distilled of its androcentric underpinnings and expanded for greater inclusion and understanding. The course will review the theory of character transformation in the stages of the two heroic journeys and evaluated against psychological development in Jungian terms and metaphysical growth in Sufi expressions. The journeys are then discussed in terms of film and literature, and further examined against scriptural stories and spiritual experiences.",

    "ClassOverview": "The past two decades have witnessed a fundamental transformation in the nature of work. Trends towards empowerment, digitization, and globalization have resulted in organizations that routinely structure work around teams. Teams connect diverse, distributed individuals, empowering them to work collaboratively. Those working in, leading, and studying teams have repeatedly observed that teams can accomplish more than the sum or member capabilities (i.e., synergy), but often accomplish less than would the same individuals working alone (i.e., process loss). This course will explore the forces that affect behavior in teams, and the factors that lead to team success. The course will explore the specific challenges associated with leading teams, some of which include: building and designing teams, managing information sharing within and across teams, structuring effective group decision processes, igniting creative thinking, enabling complex problem solving, managing team diversity and conflict, and managing teams of teams. This is an introductory course, with no prerequisites. We will use a variety of readings, activities, and classactivities to build team leadership skills. Because of the experiential nature of the course, attendance at all class meetings is required.",

By carry[ing] the animating ?spark' of consciousness itself beyond the confines of the physical body, these technologies produce an eeriness often described in supernatural terms despite their ultimately very material attributes (6). In this course, we begin with Sconce's concept of haunted media, exploring digital culture through the supernatural and vice versa. At the beginning of the course, we will each choose an artifact. Throughout the course, we will investigate our artifacts using a variety of approaches including rhetorical analysis, media archaeology, and research writing. This course teaches writing from research as a process and breaks this process down into manageable parts: writing a proposal, finding, evaluating, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and citing sources, writing a literature review, crafting arguments, giving and responding to feedback, and presenting your findings in a professional setting.",

    "ClassOverview": "Since the onset of modernity, especially since the 18th century, a family of concepts such as public opinion, public interest, and public affairs have become indispensable for understanding how society, politics, and communication practices are distinctively and complexly intertwined.  The term public signifies relatively unrestricted communication across civil society regarding governance and other matters affecting the general welfare. Theoretical articulation of the public sphere has directed critical understanding of key institutions in modern societies, including the liberal-democratic state, capitalist social relations, the media and culture industries, and social movement protest. Critique also has identified a full range of deep problems in public formations, from whether publics are ineffectual fictions to how conceptions of public identity operate as means of exclusion and oppression. This seminar will introduce the students to systematic exploration of the public as it is a network of concepts and an historical development extending into the era of digital media technologies. Readings include John Dewey, Walter Lippmann, J?rgen Habermas, Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, Nancy Fraser, Seyla Benhabib, Michael Warner, Lauren Berlant, and others.",

    "ClassOverview": "--Jump Rhythm? Technique (JRT) is a vocally accompanied, rhythm-driven method of theatre-movement training for all performing arts students.  It is directed to actors, dancers, singers, and musicians who enjoy moving their bodies rhythmically and who would also enjoy learning how to perform musical rhythms with both more precision and more inward delight.--Fueled by the beat-driven sounds of funk, hip-hop, and swing, JRT involves using the human body's primary drumbeaters - the hands, head, rhythm-singing voice, and feet.  We use these drumbeaters to turn the body into an energy-charged instrument of percussive music-making.  These drumbeaters play rhythmic accents against the drumheads of the space - both the imaginary spaces surrounding the body, the actual drummable surface of the floor, and the actual drummable surfaces of the body itself.  In this way, JRT can be thought of as a form of tap-dancing or beat-boxing through the whole body.--The class exercises and combinations explore using voice-accompanied rhythmic movement as a way to give outward physical expression to one's inside-felt emotional energies.  An African performance tradition embodied through history by both anonymous and celebrated African-American artists inspires this approach to full-bodied rhythm-making.  It is called ngoma - the Bantu word for drumming and rhythmic song-dancing.--Standing Down Straight? (SDS) guides all warm-up exercises and combinations.  SDS is a holistic method of body-and-voice training that teaches all performance students to vocalize and move with full energy without causing strain or injury to themselves.  The source of this approach to working is gravity-directed relaxation.  SDS explains how the human body is designed to work with not against gravity -- how, by working with gravity, we can launch into any performance action with more power, more relaxation, and more efficiency.",

Dunham came of age in the milieu of the Chicago Renaissance, collaborating with Black and white artists to create a new style of dancing based on her ethnographic research in the Caribbean. During the years surrounding World War II she made a national reputation performing with her company on Broadway and on the Hollywood screen. Then in the decades following the war, she traveled internationally with her company, her work implicitly and explicitly engaging the Civil Rights Movement and the struggle for decolonization. In 1965 Dunham settled in East St. Louis, where she trailblazed methods for using the arts to engage and uplift youth in the community.The class time will be split between movement and discussion. In addition to guest teachers in Dunham technique, students in this course will encounter the full range of primary sources for dance studies?film and video, oral history and memoir, unpublished manuscripts and correspondence, exhibitions of visual material, digital databases. There will also be several co-curricular outings integrated into this course?from an exhibit at the Newberry Library to a panel at the Modernist Studies Association.

It requires the discipline of interpreting what we see and hear in organizations from multiple standpoints. Accordingly, we will learn to analyze situations and craft implementation plans using three perspectives on organizations, strategic design, political and cultural. While leading and managing others always presents challenges, our goal in this course is to use the three perspectives to develop a more complete understanding of these challenges and how to address them.",

    "ClassOverview": "We tend to think of creative works in aesthetic or artistic terms: the way they tell us stories, present us with larger-than-life performers, fill our daily lives with music, or inform us about the world. However, the films, television shows, videogames, and popular recordings that we enjoy are produced, distributed, and marketed using the techniques and strategies of modern industry: that is, show business is just as much about the business as it is the show. This combination of art and industry has long sparked debate about the status of the cultural or creative industries, and the ways in which they intermingle art and commerce. What makes an authentic expression within this context? Where does the creativity lie in the complex and collaborative productions of the creative industries? What role do advertising and market research play in shaping creative products? To what degree can audiences take an active role in their experience of creative works? How have technological or legislative developments influenced the way in which creative products are produced, distributed and consumed? What is the culture of work in the creative industries, and how can it be made to be more diverse and inclusive? How can media products be made so that they cross cultural or national boundaries?This course will address these and other questions through an engagement with scholarship on a range of creative industries including film, radio and television broadcasting, popular music, advertising, animation, and digital gaming. The course is designed to provide a historical and theoretical introduction to the creative industries and to allow students to apply that knowledge to a range of industrial contexts.",

But the practices of brand management?of creating, shaping, maintaining, and contesting brand meaning?have transformed dramatically in recent decades. Technological changes have opened up the processes of branding and shifted the distribution of communicative power within consumer culture. At the same time, brands have become more personal, taking on public personalities and more explicit stances on issues of identity and justice. This course provides an overview of how these changes have altered the practices of brand management, bringing together both critical and administrative perspectives on contemporary branding. The ultimate aim is to provide students with a practical understanding of how brand management works, while also providing them with the conceptual tools to critique those practices.",

How does an amateur learn glassblowing? Why do people still flock to the opera house? How does a museum store an installation? Is there a career for hip-hop street artists? What kind of job is being a tour guide? Do record studio interns ever get a job? Why do we get the news that we get? And why should we care about all this?This course looks at ethnographies of artistic practice to better understand how culture is made, circulated, and received in social life. Aiming to go beyond the personal idiosyncrasies of individual artists and media players, it shows through a myriad of studies in cultural production, what are the factors that play the greatest role in shaping contemporary cultural production: is it about professional traditions, forms of ownership and funding, government regulations, organizational factors or the social dynamics in the interplay between owners, workers, and audiences? Sorting out the factors that shape cultural production can best be accomplished via comparative research - across geographical regions, and institutional fields. This course offers a theoretical and methodological roadmap to such a project, helping students navigate through the landscape of how contemporary culture is produced.The course has also a second objective, to sort out what is made visible and what remains invisible in contemporary society, as a non-reductive way to sociologically explore how power is aesthetically produced beyond categorical or representational analysis",

    "ClassOverview": "The field of communication does not have a canon, per se. But it does have a set of thinkers whose ideas are treated as foundational and whose work forms the basis of most graduate and undergraduate education in the field. And, as is true in so many fields, those thinkers are overwhelmingly white, cisgender, male, heterosexual, and from Europe and North America. This has produced a distinct vision within our field of what communication is, how it functions, and what normative ideas it should uphold. It theorizes communication from one specific standpoint, but then generalizes that standpoint to generate supposedly universal truths. This course aims to break free of this vision and the constraints it places on both our understandings of the world and our own theorizing. To do so, it assembles a new canon of germinal research in communication studies on race, nation, gender, and sexuality. These works do not merely theorize different forms of alterity that have been ignored or disregarded by the mainstream of the field, but rather theorize from alterity to challenge the field's foundational assumptions. These works help us develop a new vision of what communication is, how it functions, and what normative ideas it should uphold by forcing us to approach these questions from outside the assumptions of whiteness, cis-ness, maleness, heterosexuality, and Euroamericanness.",

We will explore how storytelling performances reflect our families, communities, culture, and nation. To engage the power and significance of storytelling performance we will focus on three units:  (1) Oral Narrative. Students will learn how to conduct in-depth interviews, on a particular topic, to gather oral narratives and their meanings from specific family, friends, or community members. (2) Myth. Students will read and discuss ancient and contemporary myths to unravel deeper questions about local and global experiences. (3) News Reports. Through guided instruction students will select a current news story, from electronic or newspaper journalism, they feel reveals an urgent issue they are compelled to share. Each of the three units will culminate in a performance: a solo performance of an oral narrative, a group performance of a myth and, finally, a multi-media group performance of a news story. The course is highly interactive and performance based. The unifying thread and overarching question for the course is: How does storytelling performance and creative communication help us better engage and illuminate our world and the world of others, e.g., identity, family, community, nation, social relations, political institutions and economic orders?",

    "ClassOverview": "This course will provide students with the history behind the development of the serial television format. Throughout television's history the medium has experimented with ongoing or cumulative narrative storytelling. The definition of the term seriality, however, remains ever contested even while key features remain obvious or rather taken for granted. One such feature is that serial television has characters who grow or evolve over seasons and years, rather than remain static and unchanged. Another key feature is that the stories serial television tell are meant to be ongoing with episodes building upon each other in a cumulative narrative. Furthermore, some scholars even argue that series that employ seriality are uniquely primed to tackle more complex and nuanced social and representational issues. This course then seeks to both define television seriality while also taking a historical approach in detailing key moments throughout the medium's development and evolution. The course relies heavily on the foundational work of feminist media scholars' whose perspectives and contributions on seriality remain important for any understanding of the television narrative format. We will start with primetime soap operas like Peyton's Place (ABC 1964-1969) and Dallas (CBS 1978-1991) whose novelistic or continuing drama approaches are indebted to the maligned and feminized soap opera format. We will explore hybrid narrative approaches like that of crime dramas and police procedurals including Dragnet (NBC 1951-1959) and one of the longest running series of its kind Law and Order: Special Victims Unit (NBC 1999-). We will also examine how complex narrative storytelling has many points of origin even before the rise of the re-watchability of video, DVD home collections and streaming services.",

    "ClassOverview": "From Game of Thrones fans going on an archery tour in Northern Ireland, to agroup of friends catching Pokemon on the streets of their city, to social media influencersposting and geotagging their scenic views at national parks, this course explores therelationships between space/place, experience, and digital media in today's participatoryculture. Taking a unique perspective that combines cultural studies with fan studies, mediaindustry studies, and theories of space/place, it invites students to make two critical moves:First, through an introduction to concepts that frame digital media and participatory culture inspatial terms, we will learn to think spatially about our digital media environment and participatoryconsumption. Through these concepts, students will be invited to analyze how media industriesuse spatial logics to design their media platforms, organize user experiences, encourage fanengagement, and protect their intellectual property. Second, to think about how digital mediatechnologies and logics are being mapped onto and transforming the physical spaces we find ourselves in.To make this connection, we'll travel to a wide range of places where audiences are beingactively called to go out and have an experience in branded media worlds. As we moveacross various sites of today's experience economy?from movie theaters to theme parks, fanconventions, escape rooms, film tourism destinations, AR/VR experiences, pop-up themedrestaurants, among others?we will interrogate a number of key tensions, including themes ofinclusion vs. exclusion, industry power vs. fan power, ephemerality (experience) vs. archive(data collection), and play vs. labor.Though our primary focus will be on space-based experiences built around popular mediafranchises, students will be encouraged to pursue topics that spark them. In addition totraditional screenings, screening time will be dedicated to engagement with mobile apps andgames, a trip to the VR Lab on campus, and collaborative activities. Throughout the course,students will be responsible for submitting weekly memos where they relate the course materialto their own ongoing research and experiences. Students will choose from multiple final projectoptions?creating their own space-based media experience based on a media property of theirchoosing, drafting a policy paper, or performing a spatial analysis of a site of their choosing.Students will thus leave the course not only with a critical toolkit for understanding their digitalmedia consumption practices, but also with experience analyzing, designing, and advocatingfor particular kinds of media spaces in the world.",

The class will view and analyze a range of representative films with accompanied readings from a practitioner's point of view (e.g. Wong Kar-Wai's In The Mood For Love, Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust, Athina Tsangari's The Capsule, Chantal Akerman's The Meetings of Anna, Luis Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou, Peter Brooks Marat/Sade, Michael Haneke's Code Unknown, Jane Campion's Peel, Lynne Ramsay's Small Deaths, Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Tropical Malady, Akira Kurosawa's Roshomon, et at). Students will then write and create final short film projects positing their own narrative strategies working either as individuals or in pairs.Warning: Please research the list of sample films above. Most films screened are counter-cultural works which were created to provoke a strong emotional response. Many contain what might be for some viewers disturbing depictions of violence and sexual content.

In this seminar, we will explore what possibilities exist within these fields to address these absences. We will do so through a close attention to film's formal politics and its mediation of racial and sexual difference. Throughout, we will engage with a broad range of world cinema to test the utility of concepts beyond the boundaries of classical Hollywood. Assignments will include two short reading responses and a final paper.In addition to key texts from Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan, course readings can include: Joan Copjec, Frantz Fanon, Ranjana Khanna, Homay King, David Marriott, Todd McGowan, Kaja Silverman, Kalpana Seshadri, Hortense Spillers, and Slavoj ?i?ek.Films can include the works of Alfred Hitchcock, Steve McQueen, Todd Haynes, Wong Kar Wai, Spike Lee, Larissa Sansour, Claire Denis, Lucretia Martel, David Lynch, and Federico Fellini among others.Mode of instruction: in person screenings and discussion",

    "ClassOverview": "As techniques for sonic expression have grown more sophisticated - from installation art to narrative podcasts and video games - the questions that we bring to bear on sound and its place in our lives and histories have also begun to evolve. This course aims to give sound professionals a grounding in that conversation by immersing them in Sound Studies, a new and inspiring field that occupies an intersection between the arts, social sciences and humanities.Sound Studies helps us to understand how music works through the popular media, interprets and unpacks great soundtracks and albums, uncovers the history of the sound technologies that we use, asks how hearing changes over time and across cultures, looks at the politics behind forms of vocal expression and mixing, and calls attention to sonic dimensions of environments. In recent years, Sound Studies has also been taking the form of sound and provides raw ideas for podcasts, films and other sound works. Indeed, it was scholar Murray Schafer who coined the term soundscape, a concept that is now not only used by a whole field of artists, but also by acousticians, game developers and urban planners.Each week we begin by considering significant works of sonic expression, using them as a framework to understand key questions in Sound Studies today. Though much of our emphasis will be on sound in popular forms of media, we will also consider various forms of sound technology, sound art, and sound performance. Students will be introduced to a range of sound-based industries and learn how they work together. Key works of sound art and design will demonstrate the aesthetics of sound, for example: the expressive ways in which sounds are combined with images in media culture; and how mediated sounds facilitate new encounters with the lived environment. Students will gain an understanding of how sound mediates identity and provides a medium for cultural expression.",

Our exploration will be accompanied by writings on scenography and theories drawn from new materialism, phenomenology, and object performance that will illuminate both our practice and research.

There is a bias, certainly in American popular culture, against comedy, as can be seen in how few comic movies ever get nominated or win Academy Awards. However, comedy both set trends within society and is reflective of how people understand their world, so this course will take a serious look at the interrelation between comedy and American culture. Topics will include: philosophical theories of why we laugh, historical beginnings of prominent comic forms such as sitcoms and political humor, and comic innovations found in stand-up and sketch. There will also be opportunities to perform in class as a means of further deepening our understanding of comedy through lived experience. Through this class, we hope to gain a better understanding of comedy's influence in our culture and in our individual lives - plus, I hope we will laugh a lot.",

Over the quarter we will investigate how we can bring a greater sense of innovation and risk taking to our rehearsal process and experiment with new types of rehearsal methodologies. Students will learn Shana Cooper's original rehearsal methodology called Essence Work, a technique which aids theater makers in being responsive to the individual needs of a project. Essence work also enables all artists to contribute more deeply to the creative process, and to take greater ownership over the production.In addition to a close investigation of Essence Work, students will study the artistic processes and techniques employed by innovative artists like choreographers Twyla Tharp and Pina Bausch. This course is an opportunity to expand your understanding of and experience with non-traditional rehearsal methods and techniques.  It will help you to break open your habits of creation and storytelling, and develop the tools to innovate your artistic process and the work generated by that practice. Both directors and actors will physically participate during in-class explorations.",

Gaining familiarity with GIS therefore will be one of the major outcomes of the course. A focus of the program will be researching and completing a final project that identifies, analyzes and proposes solutions to an issue of interest to student groups.",

At the same time, there is complexity in such collective and social action, and organizational life is often marked by a number of recurring and difficult problems. The purpose of this course is to help students understand the complexities of organizations.  It is designed to provide an exposure to theories of organization, important organizational issues and processes, and a variety of strategies and tactics useful to successful organizational leaders and followers alike.",

Can goodness be taught? What do we mean by a good teacher, a good student, a good school? We'll also consider the relationship between schooland the larger society as we work toward articulating our own philosophies of education.These essential questions will guide our course and we will consult a broad range of texts in different genres and media, including:Philosophical essays/excerpts: from our most enduring philosophers (Socrates, Locke, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, Emerson, Dewey, Whitehead,) to important contemporary voices, (Martha Nussbaum, Maxine Greene, Paolo Freire, Howard Gardner).Literary Texts: Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye; Ethan Canin's novella The Palace Thief; excerpts from Kazuo Ishiguro and John McPhee; poems by Whitman, Kinnell, and Hughes.Nonfiction texts on education: Refugee High by Elly Fishman and The Tyranny of Meritocracy by Michael Sandel.Films: To Be and to Have; Hoop Dreams; School of Rock.Podcasts: Against the Rules; Schooled: the Podcast; This American Life",

This body of literature includes theories related to the cognitive, psychological and social identity development of college students as well as how and when students change in college.  This course will also explore how theory informs the practice of working with and counseling college students.  The theories used in this course were selected because they have been especially helpful to college educators to facilitate and enhance the growth and development of students.  Understanding and appreciating student development is a key factor in our ability to reach an institution's stated learning outcomes and to help students reach their full potential.This study of student development experience on our campuses becomes even more important during these unprecedented times in our country and in American higher education.  A global pandemic, social unrest regarding social justice for all, economic challenges and societal divides are before us like never before.  How will this affect college students and their intellectual, personal identity, moral and decision-making development?  We do not know yet but we have an opportunity to explore these issues together in our learning community this quarter.",

What counts as fact vs. opinion vs. belief and so on; who gets to decide and under what conditions? How is knowledge produced and how does it gain traction?  How does the source and type of knowledge interact with socio-political-cultural constructs and systems of power and, in turn, how can knowledge be used to produce and/or perpetuate power and privilege or to empower those who are marginalized? Finally, how does what we do in SESP and at Northwestern as both consumers and producers of knowledge fit within the landscape of these questions?In this course students will explore these and other questions to gain insight into the social production, distribution, consumption, interpretation, and operationalization of knowledge. Using primarily seminar-style discussion, the first portion of the course focuses on building and analyzing theoretical frameworks and applied texts in order to generate a working understanding of knowledge in its myriad forms.  Among our goals for the first portion of the course is to tie theoretical,  academic, and folk knowledges to everyday experiences and the world around us writ large.  The second portion of the class will involve a series of applied of cases studies, including welcoming members of the SESP faculty community to present on their research, which we will work to bring into conversation with our generated frameworks regarding the sources, types, and implications of knowledge.",

We also explore collective Holocaust memory and the development of mainstream framings of Holocaust history. We consider Jewish, Roma, and other victim narratives, including national memorialization, rituals of commemoration, and the development of Holocaust memorials, museums, and institutions in the United States and around the world. And we study how we have come to remember the Nazi perpetrators and their collaborators. We draw on course texts, including film and fiction, to ask questions about the relationships between individual and collective memories, as well as between commemoration and education.",

Psychological, interpersonal, social, cognitive, moral and physical development will be studied within the contexts of family, peer group, and school.  Theoretical perspectives will be explored in relation to empirical research, field studies, first person accounts, and imaginative works.  Special emphasis will be given to the adolescent's subjective experience and to the remembered accounts of our own adolescence.  The course will encompass a life course/life span perspective by exploring the period following adolescence proper (often referred to in the literature as emerging adulthood) to include adult midlife.  The course will argue that understanding adolescence is advanced with a corresponding appreciation of adulthood.",

    "ClassOverview": "Social policy is integral to the fabric of society. It helps to determine who has access to resources and services, regulates how those are obtained, and is constantly negotiated by changing ideas about public need and the common good. A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation.The first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents.",

    "ClassOverview": "As understanding of identity and bias increased, Kimberle Crenshaw developed the theory of intersectionality which challenges us to consider various components of identities as having the potential to create overlapping and intersecting experiences. When an individual holds multiple identities that have traditionally been marginalized, any discrimination experienced will be different than someone without that unique blend of identities. To use Crenshaw's initial example in 1989, Black women experience a different type of racism than Black men, and a different form of sexism than White women. Thirty years later, researchers still are coming to terms with what this means in the public sphere, but also in research which underlines the importance of thinking about identity more comprehensively and completely. In this class, we will begin by addressing the question of what intersectionality is. We will also consider how considering identity as intersectional alters our understanding of policy, and what policy should address. Importantly, we will consider how to incorporate intersectionality into a basic framework of research and analysis through a term-long project.",

    "ClassOverview": "How do anthropologists understand and investigate the social and cultural contexts of health and illness? This course will examine the diverse ways in which humans use cultural resources to cope with pain, illness, suffering and healing in diverse cultural contexts. In addition, we will analyze various kinds of medical practices as cultural systems, examining how disease, health, body, and mind are socially constructed, how these constructions articulate with human biology, and vice versa. The course will provide an introduction to the major theoretical frameworks that guide anthropological approaches to studying human health-related behavior. Theory will be combined with case studies from a number of societies, from India, Japan, Brazil, and Haiti to the U.S. and Canada, enabling students to identify similarities across seemingly disparate cultural systems, while at the same time demonstrating the ways in which American health behaviors and practices are socially embedded and culturally specific. The course will emphasize the overall social, political, and economic contexts in which health behavior and health systems are shaped, and within which they must be understood.",

    "ClassOverview": "Food can seem like the most mundane and banal aspect of our everyday lives, but it is much more than the simple sustenance of a meal on the table. In addition to fueling our bodies, it is a powerful form of communication, a means to construct individual identity and to connect with others, and a way to create a shared culture as well as strengthen social ties. Food is also a crucial aspect of modern media production as seen in the explosion of books, magazines, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, television programs, and feature films devoted to the subjects of cooking and eating. In this seminar, we will explore multiple aspects of food as communication, with the objective of gaining insights into the powerful and prevalent ways that our relationships with food communicate and negotiate our identities and cultures.",

This writing class explores how we have defined, pursued and, at times, attained happiness. We ask the question: is happiness a goal or a journey? We examine how the ideal of happiness finds expression in our culture through philosophy, art, literature, music, and film. We also explore social phenomena such as the quest for higher education, the explosion of the self-help industry, and the ebb and flow of our consumer culture.The course is conducted completely online.

During the early modern period, the world became increasingly interconnected through the exchange of commodities, people, technology, germs, and ideas--so much so that some scholars have argued it saw the first globalization. This course will examine how this first globalization came about and why it mattered. Rather than focusing on a single region or nation, this course will examine the entire world, with an emphasis on the big-picture connections, exchanges, and conflicts that shaped the modern world order. In this course, we will encounter places, cultures, and voices that are typically excluded from historical narratives, and we will consider how familiar historical stories may appear different when seen from a global lens.Schedule note: This course will meet remotely, with weekly remote synchronous sessions held on the scheduled day.",

We will consider biological, psychological, and societal causes of dysfunction. We will also explore how psychopathology has been understood throughout history, how those views have evolved to inform psychological treatments available today, and how culture continues to play a role in shaping our conceptualization of mental illness. Lastly, opportunities for prevention and organized efforts to promote mental health will be discussed, including research on how to cultivate happiness. Lectures will draw from real-world examples, fictional depictions of mental illness, and clinical case studies. Students will be assessed through a midterm exam, a final exam (non-cumulative), and a research paper. Carries social science credit.",

Assignments and projects help develop students' analytic and critical thinking skills and challenge them to apply statistical analysis with real world data. The course contains three parts: methods of data collection, techniques for data organization and analysis, and techniques for interpreting data using statistical methodologies. Students will learn not only how to appropriately collect and analyze data, but how to draw conclusions from their data for use in decision-making. The course emphasizes use of Microsoft Excel for graphing and data analysis in homework assignments. Students will also collect and analyze a data set of personal interest for the final project. A final paper will also be prepared. Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint techniques relevant to the final project will be taught in class, however, a basic understanding of these applications is expected.

We will learn about the varying traditions of written and unwritten constitutions, civil and common law and the foundations and structures of separation of powers and judicial review as we compare the responses of democratic countries such as the U.S., Canada, India, Italy, France, Germany, Great Britain, South Africa and Australia to emergencies such as COVID-19 and in the application of fundamental liberal rights and liberties to questions of capital crimes, abortion, religion, race and gender. Students will learn to think critically about the U.S. Constitution and the different ways in which constitutional democracies provide for public order, counter-majoritarian governance, equality and protection of the rights of minorities through rule of law and question whether constitutional solutions can address the kinds of social and political problems we have today.",

    "ClassOverview": "Popular discourses about the ?post-racial' era notwithstanding, race still suffuses many aspects of culture and policy in the western world, especially Blackness. Moreover, critical arguments about the ways gender, sexuality, class, and nationality fracture race, have questioned unitary notions of Blackness. Why does Blackness still persist despite these challenges? How is this category continually reconstituted through social, economic, cultural, legal, political, etc. discourses and institutions? Drawing on theoretical discourses from the social sciences and humanities, the course surveys Blackness as a global category of critical analysis for both historical and contemporary social formations in the African Diaspora. In addition, by considering the different manifestations of Blackness as well as other forms of racialized identity across the globe from historical, empirical, and theoretical perspectives, it also considers how gender, class, sexuality, and nationality shape the territories of Blackness. We will study scholarly works that address, on the one hand, the continued significance of slavery, colonialism, incarceration, segregation, other forms of racialized violence, and, on the other hand, texts that imagine future forms of Blackness.",

    "ClassOverview": "Between 2015 and 2020 the political movement Black Lives Matter emerged in the US and different parts of the world, concerned with the mobilizations against police violence towards Black populations and oppositions to structural white supremacy. In 2020 the scale and longevity of Black Lives Matter was such that the New York Times referred to it as the largest social movement in US history. Certainly, there had been nothing like it since the anti-colonial movements and civil rights movements of the late 1950s and mid-1960s or the Black power movement of the 1970s, all of which had reverberations and replications among different Black populations across the world (e.g. Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean). This course seeks to introduce students to the historical and political underpinnings of issues and questions raised by the Black Lives Matter movement, examining their meaning in relation to Black politics and as part of what Cedric Robinson famously referred to as the Black Radical Tradition. Students will be encouraged to think about the importance of the relation between history and theory in engaging with the formations of Slavery, Colonialism and Racism; as well as developing understandings of Black political thought in relation to movements that include, Black Marxism, Black Liberalism, Black Power, Black Feminism, Black Lives Matter, Afropessimism, Black Anarchism and Afrofuturism.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course examines multiple approaches to undertaking Black Studies research and equips students to execute a scholarly agenda with deliberate attention to methods of data collection and analysis. The course is divided into two parts. The first half concerns readings in Black Studies scholarship that exemplify a few major approaches: historical-archival, cultural criticism, critical theory, and ethnographic and interview based methods. The second half of the course will be based on student presentations of individual research projects at discrete stages such as bibliographical research, identification of primary sources (e.g., identification of ideal research subjects in the case of research interviews or ethnography), and explication of method and theory. This will culminate in a research prospectus, which will serve as the final product of the seminar.",

Scholars have more fully examined earlier internationalist movements such as Garveyism, the Pan-African Congresses, communism and socialism across the African Diaspora, and various anticolonial formations and struggles of the early to mid-twentieth century. This course spans the late 1960s through the 1980s, focusing on US-based solidarity movements with southern Africa, including the struggles against Portuguese colonialism and apartheid South Africa.

This is described as Black Conceptual Methodologies. It explores these ideas through various critiques of western critical theory and elaborations of Black conceptualizations in relation to various questions of history, power, hegemony, ideology, resistance and narrativity. In order to build towards this exposition students will be introduced to techniques for evaluating and formulating concepts, as well as identifying the methods of Black conceptualizations. With reference to theoretical or ethnographic aspects of research, students will be required to undertake applied conceptual work in their assessed papers, part of which will involve each student innovating and developing their own Black methodological concept. Overall the course will challenge students to think more carefully, critically and methodologically about the explanatory impact, role and applications of concepts in Black studies research.",

To that end, some of our sessions will be devoted to reading and responding to one another's work. While it can be difficult and intimidating to publicly present your work, and to publicly critique or question another's work, we will undertake both in the spirit of support and assistance in the hopes of creating a community of researchers, writers, and scholars. Becoming a careful reader, responder, and recipient of constructive criticism are invaluable skills that fundamentally inform the process by which virtually all scholarly work is produced.",

Integral to this process are the methods they use to collect and analyze data, as well as the ways in which scientists work together as a community to interpret evidence and draw conclusions. In this class, we will take a multidisciplinary approach to examining biological thought and action and their social ramifications. We will seek to understand science as a social pursuit: the work of human beings with individual, disciplinary, and cultural differences, and requiring tremendous investments in training and equipment. Does it matter that participation in science is more accessible to some than to others? How do biases, assumptions, uncertainty, and error manifest in scientific work? What is the history of scientific values such as objectivity and reproducibility? The course will conclude by investigating current topics of public debate",

The impact of such alternative realities on society and history cannot be discounted. They have been used to support nationalistic agendas, racial biases, and religious movements, all of which can have considerable influence on contemporary society.In this course, we will study fantastic stories, puzzles, hoaxes, imaginative worlds and alternative theories. We will learn when, how and what kinds of evidence these alternative theories have used to fascinate the public and illustrate their hoaxes. We will question such theories by using critical thinking and analytical tools to diagnose what is fact and fiction.

How can we understand community building at Northwestern University after pandemic turned the world upside-down and transformed basic social practices?  To find out, you will study and practice anthropology's most famous method of research and writing, ethnography.  Along with weekly readings, student-run bi-weekly roundtable discussions will pair NU campus groups with Evanston organizations for discussions focusing on intersecting social and economic power structures such as race, gender, sexuality, and economic inequality.  Discussions and readings will inform your ethnographic observation of campus and local communities.  Conducting participant-observation research will empower you to 1. make sense of what's going on around you in the current moment, 2. turn an analytical eye toward Northwestern, and 3. critically develop your new role as a college student.  Requirements include participation in class discussion and roundtables, fieldnotes exercises, and one short article presentation. These all build toward a focused final project on an aspect of college life you choose and observe throughout the quarter.

We will examine the main methods in every archaeologists' took kit: archaeological survey, excavation, and materials analysis.  Over the course of the quarter, we will take what interests you about archaeology and turn that in to a design for an archaeological research project.  We will learn how to frame archaeological questions in terms of intellectual merit (the potential to advance knowledge) and broader impacts (the potential to benefit society).  The main goal of the course is to design an archaeological research project.  We will achieve this goal across the quarter through writing a proposal to conduct an archaeological research project designed by the student.  We will review successful proposals by archaeologists to decipher how researchers link theory, data, methods, and analysis in their archaeological research design and use these as templates for our own project designs. Upon completion of the course students should be comfortable with designing archaeological research and writing research proposals to get funding for their project, important skills to know whether you plan to continue in archaeology and academia, or not.________________________________________",

This course examines one of the best-known pre-Columbian civilizations in the New World: Ancient Maya civilization. The course will focus on the achievements of the ancient Maya - one of the most advanced civilizations in history - prior to the Spanish conquest in ca. 1500 AD. We will look at archaeology - from temples, cities, and hieroglyphic writing to farmers' homes and fields - to explore ancient Maya daily lives.The course will begin with the words of the ancient Maya.  We will read excerpts from the Popol Vuh, the Sacred Book of the Quich? Maya.  We will then study and learn to decipher in a rudimentary fashion, the ancient Maya hieroglyphs, to gain insight into Maya beliefs, religion, and worldview. The course will then turn to archaeology's material record of buildings, temples, and artifacts to learn about aspects of ancient Maya life that were not written down and types of people, like everyday people, not recorded in written texts.  Major topics will include the rise of ancient Maya civilization and the ancient Maya social, economic, and political systems, subsistence, and religion. The course concludes with an in- depth study of daily life in the ancient Maya world. We will explore what it was like to be a Maya farmer living in the small Maya farming community of Chan in Belize, and discover the lessons of sustainable lifestyles that we can learn from ancient Maya farmers.",

The course follows the integrated approach which blends the standard Arabic, Fu???, and the dialect or colloquial language, ?mmiyya, in a way that reflects the authentic practice of native Arabic speakers. To develop reading and writing skills we will be using Modern Standard Written Arabic called Fu???.  To develop speaking and listening skills we will be using an educated spoken version of the ?mmiyya of the Levantine dialect.  The integrated approach is an effective, logical, and economical method of instruction that successfully teaches the complexities of the Arabic sociolinguistic and diglossic situation and prepares students fully for the realities of the Arabic world.Arabic 111-1, taught in the Fall Quarter, is the first quarter of first-year Arabic.  Topics covered during this quarter are: The writing system (alphabet); the number system; and about 200 basic everyday words covering self-identification, family, work, the weather, transportation, clothing, colors, and food.",

    "ClassOverview": "The time we have in the print studio is precious. It can be a reprieve from the social and political pressures of the world outside the studio. But printmaking at the scale that we are able to perform here, is an elaborate process that requires a great deal of space and equipment. This process may become more difficult to engage with after you leave the supportive environment of this institution. Therefore our time here is also pressing.In this course we will explore printmaking through the notion of press time, pressing times, and precious time. We will think about the temporal nature of printmaking and engage with how print's many processes require a commitment in time to produce results (impressions) that appear on the page as instantaneous. We will also consider how the time we have in the studio functions in relation to the time we experience in the outside world and in contemporary media. Being at a socially and politically challenging moment in history, we will consider the feeling of being out of time and how an art practice?and particularly a printmaking practice?can engage with, slowdown or accelerate this contemporary feeling. Last, we will discuss the history of print as a technique which greatly reduces the time needed to reproduce texts and images. We will discuss this acceleration and how contemporary practices in print might engage with these histories.",

The concurrent rise of European mercantile and colonial interests of the English, Dutch and French East India Companies in the region further contributed to a ?worlding' of Mughal aesthetics.

What has made South Asian literature so popular, especially when it deals with somber questions of anticolonial resistance, postcolonial nation-building, violence, and loss? This course will introduce students to twentieth and twenty-first century South Asian Literatures in English characterized by exciting stylistic innovations in magical realism, modernist language games, lyrical prose, and biting satire. By examining novels, short stories, poems, political writing, and films, we will ask, how has literature shaped both the promise and failure of the postcolonial nation-state? What might South Asian writing teach us about the global project of democratic world-making? Topics of discussion will include gender, caste, empire, globalization, migrancy, and environmentalism.",

Indeed, this aspiration for reunion expresses a vigorous and deep historical belief in the shared ethnic and cultural heritage of the entire peninsula that imagines North and South Korea as tragically and temporarily separated entities bound to be reunited. At the same time, the contemporary everyday meaning of the word Korea (hankuk) is often limited to only their nation for many young South Koreans. How do we understand this seeming contradiction? With this question in mind, this course provides students with a set of critical frames for exploring Korean history and culture while simultaneously questioning presumptions of a nation or civilization with an unchanging or seemingly natural essence. This course focuses on the modern cultural history of the Korean peninsula by investigating the discursive constructions of national subjectivity carried out by disparate groups and social institutions since the Choso?n Dynasty's inclusion in the modern nation-state world system and the political realities resulting from those discursive constructions. The term culture in the course title is defined in a broad sense as it encompasses not only works of art but also systems of thought and social practices developed throughout the history of modern Korea.",

In this course, we will explore the meanings and practices surrounding food in South Asia and its diaspora. Whether in conflicts over forbidden foods, in crises of famine, in exoticist evocations of the land of spices, or in nostalgic yearnings for the lost flavors of home, food has profound power over the imagination and the body. We will examine literature, films, cookbooks, and other materials - some of which we will eat! - to understand the roles that food plays in ritual, politics, art, and everyday life.",

The goal is to understand their significance in East Asian cultures, as well as consider what we can learn from these texts today. This course will probe the following questions: What are the major themes, dilemmas, and issues these texts address? How can humans achieve contentment in the world? What are the moral values these texts instill? Beyond this historical focus, this course will also reflect on ways that these literary and religious texts have been appropriated and adapted in the modern context. Each period dedicated to a specific text will be preceded by an introduction to the tradition it represents offering an historical background together with biographical and/or content outlines. Format The course format will include a combination of lecture and discussion. Students will be encouraged to exercise critical thinking and to participate in class discussions.

    "ClassOverview": "AY 21-22How have urban Chinese challenged the authoritarian rule of the Chinese Communist Party in the twenty-first century?  What are the activist causes around which urban Chinese have rallied despite the risk of state repression?  Given that activists risk persecution, prison, and torture, who would do this?  How do activists maintain the emotional resilience to stand up to authoritarian rule?  What are activists' tactics and strategies?  To answer these questions, we will study reporters, labor organizers, environmental activists, religious activists, lawyers, and feminist activists.Many activists oppose the authoritarian state in the name of freedom.  I have found that many urban Chinese are happy, or at least content, in their lives today.  The insight that hundreds of millions of people can be happy or content even though they are lacking freedom is so astonishing to me, I have begun to question my own understanding of freedom.  Is freedom a specifically Western concept?  Should the notion of freedom have universal relevance?  Should we demand of the Chinese people that they democratize?  Or is this demand Orientalist?  Or racist?  Is the demand that Chinese democratize another way of saying, They must become like us?  The Chinese Communist Party is a threat to United States democracy.  Thinking about China and acting toward China, how are we to combine the defense of our democracy and the injunction to stay clear of Orientalism?  Who is a greater threat to our democracy, the Chinese Communist Party or the Republican Party?  It turns out that we, unfortunately, cannot study Chinese activists without finding a framework to evaluate Chinese authoritarian rule in political and ethical terms.Evaluating Chinese authoritarian rule involves thinking about ourselves.  Are some Americans benefitting from authoritarian rule in China?  Is the Chinese Communist Party profitable for some Americans?  Would the United States economy collapse without Chinese poverty?  Who are we in moral, political, and ethical terms to claim the high ground and criticize the Chinese Communist Party?  It is possible to argue that Western modernity is flawed beyond rescue.  From this perspective, are we in a desperate search for an alternative modernity?  Can China be our inspiration for an alternative modernity?  Or, would you agree with those Hong Kong activists who have coined the term Chinazi to indicate that, in their view, China increasingly resembles Hitler's Germany?",

This course features a combination of critical theory and geopolitical history with an emphasis on asking how we understand various media forms, technologies, and texts that are from East Asia. Students will read different and sometimes competing sets of critical approaches and methods that theorize media forms and cultures in East Asia. We will especially problematize the qualifying phrase in Asia or the binary opposition between culture and (media) technology. While learning the key theoretical tools to understand media in Asia, students will also learn to question the assumed universality of the concept media while dealing with the geopolitical differences of the non-West, in this case East Asia. For instance, students will be learning and asking what we can gain or miss from analytical approaches that focus on the national characteristics (e.g. Koreanness) or East Asianness of modern technologies such as K-pop machinery, Japanese anime, or the Chinese typewriter. Therefore, this course not only will provide students with an introduction to media technologies and cultures in East Asia, but also teach ways to rethink the Eurocentric theorization of media and modernity as well as the conceptualization of East Asian culture as fixed, static, homogenous, and particular. Each week students will be reading or watching a media text paired with readings on relevant theoretical or historical problems.",

    "ClassOverview": "The word biology describes both the characteristics and processes of life and living organism, as well as the discipline that studies these. Like all the natural sciences, the study of biology is a data-driven endeavor, concerned with describing, predicting and understanding natural phenomena based on evidence from observation and experimentation. But like all human activities, it does not exist in objective isolation, but rather within a societal context. And biological phenomena, such as infection and disease, interact with non-biological elements of human society. This course aims to contextualize the study of biology towards a better understanding of how social and cultural histories and dynamics have had a profound effect on both biological research as well as biological phenomena, and how social, political and economic parameters influence the impact of scientific breakthroughs and the outcomes of biological events such as epidemics. The topics we will cover, among others: the cultural, political and societal barriers to reaping the benefits of biological research; the damaging legacies of racism, sexism and colonialism on the biological research enterprise; the role of communications in the field of biology; and select biological topics in evolution, genetics and disease. Students will learn from press articles, academic literature and non-fiction books (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot; Pandemic, by Sonia Shah).",

    "ClassOverview": "Change in the genetic composition of populations over time is the basis of evolution. Evolution occurs when mutation introduces new alleles that replace existing alleles in populations via one of two mechanisms. Replacement can occur by chance (genetic drift) or by encoding a superior phenotype (natural selection). Natural selection produces one of the major features of the living world, adaptation. We will model these processes for single-locus traits, DNA sequences, and phenotypic traits. When populations are separated from one another geographically, they inevitably take different evolutionary paths; it is in this manner that most species are formed. These latter processes-change within lineages and diversification among lineages-have been iterated over staggeringly long periods of time, producing another major feature of the living world, its breathtaking biodiversity. We will familiarize ourselves with the history and diversity of life on earth by examination of the fossil record, and by inferring relationships among species using phylogenetic methods.",

    "ClassOverview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*The instructor of Lessons in Non-Profit Management is: Monique JonesThis course is jointly sponsored by Business Institutions and a student organization called campusCatalyst.  The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector.  The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements.  Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector.  To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management.  Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.  The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.  The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.  This course is an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, learn and apply a new set of skills and knowledge while impacting the community.",

Through the course, students will learn how to price and evaluate a wide variety of financial instruments including depository receipts, credit default swaps, convertible bonds and distressed debt.Some Interesting Questions We Will Explore in This Class:?\tIs the Efficient Markets Hypothesis still relevant today??\tHow prevalent are instances of inefficiency in financial markets??\tWhat are the most common sources of financial market inefficiency??\tDo bona fide arbitrage opportunities still exist today??\tWhat role does behavioral economics play in market inefficiency??\tDo hedge funds really have edge/alpha??\tWhat markets tend to exhibit instances of inefficiency more than others?",

Modern techniques have allowed scientists to better study small materials, and the nanotech we read about in science fiction novels can now become real products found in our world. In this seminar, we will discuss what is so special about the size range of 1-100 nm (the nanoscale) and why particles of this size have a such a unique niche in nature and technology. We will explore the properties of these materials and why quantum mechanical effects allow for this scale to be so important. Discussions of medicines, electronics, catalysts, additives, and imaging agents that include nanoparticles will allow us to explore the wide range of current directions of nanotechnology. As we look to future applications, we will debate the implications of these materials on the environment, human health, and safety. Regulatory bodies in the United States and around the globe have discussed the ethical and social impact of nanomaterials, and we will investigate their role is assuring the nanomaterials we use leave a positive impact on the world.",

As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year.

That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion.  This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results.  For example:- A synthetic chemist must have enough knowledge of reaction mechanisms and synthetic techniques to be able to prepare a specific compound in a single, or more likely, multi-step procedure.  Upon successful preparation of the compound, one must perform a variety of analyses to characterize the sample and confirm that the desired compound has been made.- A physical or analytical chemist who wishes to study the kinetics of a reaction, the spectroscopy of a specific compound, or the use of an analytical technique for characterization of specific compounds often must have the ability to synthesize the compounds of interest.In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis.  You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses.Chemistry 350-1: Roughly half of this course deals with the advanced analytical techniques mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.

Our emphasis will, however, not be analysis of antquity itself but rather of American engagement with that antquity, partcularly in film. From reflectons of ancient Rome in Star Wars to the adaptaton of Greek comedy in Spike Lee's Chiraq, we will examine not just how antquity permeates American culture, but how popular art creatvely and critcally engages with Classical traditons. We will also consider engagement with Classical antquity in some non-cinematc media as well, such as the graphic novel and even the architecture of the city of Chicago. Through writng and research assignments students will hone their ability to interpret and explain the role of Classical traditons in the modern world.",

Although we cover a range of different types of popular culture from various times and places, we will discuss a number of common issues, such as, who funds these spectacles, who is in the audience, what kind of ideological claims are being made, and what can we learn from ancient popular culture about class, gender, identity, et cetera?",

This includes understanding the structure, function, and development of brain biology, conceptualizing the mechanisms and consequences of mental activity, building systems that simulate these operations, and enhancing human thought and behavior.  The power of the field of Cognitive Science is a direct function of its interdisciplinary approach - researchers and theorists working in Cognitive Science utilize many different traditions, conceptual frameworks, and methodologies.  All of these resources are brought to bear in generating and testing hypotheses, theoretical models, technologies, and applications.This course provides a introduction for students to core concepts and emerging questions in the field of Cognitive Science.  We will become familiar with historical and contemporary topics taking place in labs and design centers around the world, as well as immerse ourselves in projects now happening at Northwestern University.  The instructional methods we will use include article readings, lectures, research talks, and class discussions/group work.  Each class will also include invited speakers from departments and programs across NU, discussing their research through informal presentations and Q&A sessions.",

    "ClassOverview": "To sell one's soul, to strike a bargain with the devil, or even to beat the devil at his own game?these expressions and similar ones continue to enjoy undiminished popularity.  For more than five-hundred years the legend of Faust has served as means to express the daring and danger of pursuing an aspiration even if it comes at the cost of one's soul. The specter of a Faustian bargain often appears when narratives identify individuals whose inordinate achievements are both destructive and self-destructive.  The theme of Faust provides a perspective in which one must thus reflect on the highest and lowest values.Dr. Faustus has undergone many mutations since he first appeared in central Europe around the early sixteenth century.  This class will begin with a question at the foundation of the Faust legend:  what is a soul, and what is worth?   While examining these and kindred questions about the nature of the self, the class will continually reflect on what we are doing when we evaluate a work of art in relation to the culture of its time or period.  In addition to listening to some musical compositions and reading some shorter texts, we will examine the earliest versions of Faust, which derives from the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation and then proceed to read Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's great drama of cosmic knowledge and sexual seduction, Faust I, followed by selections from its strange sequel Faust II, in which Faust invents paper money and then becomes a real-estate developer or social-engineer who wants to reorganize the very nature of our planet.  We will ask what Goethe, near the end of his life, gave to world literature (a term of his own invention) when he presented his final version of Faust as a man committed to a total terrestrial transformation that inadvertently destroys innocent lives.  As a conclusion to our analysis of Goethe's Faust, we will read two very different kinds of poetic responses, Paul Celan's Death Fugue and Carol Ann Duffy's Mrs. Faust.  And in the final two weeks of the class we will view three versions of the Faust legend for our times, beginning with the story of the bluesman Robert Johnson, as represented in Peter Meyer's Can't You Hear the Wind Howl?, followed by Sophie Barthes' Cold Souls and concluding with Danny Boyle's Yesterday.",

The course approaches this question by considering several key trends in Latin American literature in the second half of the twentieth century. Focusing on novels, short fiction, and testimonial writing & film, we will study representative works from the so-called pre-Boom, Boom, and post-Boom decades (1940s-50s, 1960s-70s & beyond). Although the new narrative is often identified with the Boom era--when Latin American literature exploded onto the world stage--and with Boom novels, we will take a broader view to consider the diverse types of narrative representing new currents in the region. Primary materials will be selected from writers such as Borges, Cort?zar, Donoso, Ferr?, Fuentes, Garc?a M?rquez, Mench?, Puig, Rulfo, Shua, or Valenzuela.",

    "ClassOverview": "his course will examine graphic narratives in the context of global Jewish culture of the last century, focusing on how they have represented the Holocaust as history and memory over time. We will look at the historical and aesthetic development of graphic narrative art in relation to the representation of the Holocaust. To this end, we will scrutinize: (1) Jewish graphic narratives produced during World War II, such as Will Eisner's Spirit. The Tale of the Dictator's Reform (1941) and Horst Rosenthal's Mickey Mouse in the Gurs Internment Camp (1942); (2) 1st generation Jewish American graphic narratives representing the Holocaust, in particular Bernie Krigstein and Al Feldstein's Master Race (1955) and Will Eisner's To the Heart of the Storm (1991); (3) the post-1980s development of (auto)biographic graphic narratives about World War II by the 1.5 generation of Jewish Americans (Miriam Katin' We Are on our Own and Letting It Go), the second generation (Art Spiegelman's Maus and Martin Lemelman's Mendel's Daughter and Two Cents Plain) and the third (plus) generation (Amy Kurzweil's Flying Couch, Leela Corman's The Book of the Dead and The Blood Road, Emil Ferris's My Favorite Thing Is Monsters); (4) contemporary non-Jewish (auto)biographic graphic narratives focusing on perpetrators and Holocaust memory: Nora Krug's Belonging. A German Reckons with History and Home (2018). In our class discussions, we will assess the ways in which Jewish artists have utilized the possibilities of graphic narratives to explore the impact of the Holocaust on Jewish identity and historical experiences and we will also consider the impact of gender and perpetrators' actions on Holocaust representation. We will also examine the dynamics of Holocaust representation in the case of artists that have published multiple graphic narratives concentrating on the Holocaust. We will pay particular attention to how and why different generations of artists use similar or distinct forms of Holocaust construction and what topics they primarily broach.",

We will begin this seminar by carefully reading theorists and philosophers (Marx, Derrida, Butler) who develop?often via literary works?accounts of the structure and function of the law and its relation to justice. The seminar will then turn to two interrelated questions. The first unit Prisons and Fugitives asks how the law functions through modes of arrest, detention, incarceration, or punishment?and whether and how it is possible to run from the law or lead a wayward life. Readings might come from Kafka, Foucault, contemporary discourses on prison abolition and surveillance regimes, and Saidiya Hartman. The second unit titled Strike (with readings from Du Bois, Melville, Benjamin) thinks about modes of refusal and stoppage, and whether they might bring us closer to justice.",

The major focus of this course is the innovative system of film thinking invented by Eisenstein and known in the history of cinema as Russian/Soviet Montage. Nowadays, it is widely used by all national cinematographies, including Hollywood. One of the objectives of this course is to help students' understanding the ways of watching the silent and early sound films, which demand a good deal of our own intellectual participation. The goal of this course is to help the students to enrich themselves with the innovative cinematographic concepts and perspectives, start enjoying them, and to be able to trace their roots in contemporary filmmaking.Each course-session includes a lecture on the film, class discussion of the readings and films. All films are available on Canvas and all screenings take place at home. All films are mandatory. Class discussion will be about film watched at home and precede the lecture. Some screening will repeat in class with Professor's commentaries. It is mandatory to read (or watch at home) all the materials provided in the syllabus and on Canvas.",

Beginning with nineteenth- and early twentieth-century debates about historical materialism and the uses of history and literary history as disciplines, we will survey the development and invocations of historicism as an approach to literary study across colonial, imperial, modernist, postcolonial, and environmental episodes in literary history. How does historicism fare in addressing diverse periods? For example, while British Victorian studies recently faced critiques of dominant tendencies toward positivist historicism, some of the most energizing work in postcolonial literary studies has been deeply historicist in inclination. How has climate change provoked new visions of historical time crossing the traditional periods? Must we continue to follow Jameson's famous injunction to always historicize! or do we rather find ourselves in a weak theoretical state of affairs by which we cannot not historicize? How do we understand Roland Barthes's claim that a little formalism turns one away from History, but ? a lot brings one back to it? What is historicism good for? What are its varieties? Where does it fall short? Readings may include works by G.W.F. Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hayden White, Susan Buck-Morss, Fredric Jameson, Walter Benjamin, Antonio Gramsci, Saidiya Hartman, Reinhart Koselleck, Sianne Ngai, Michael Denning, Sylvia Wynter, Lisa Lowe, Michel-Rolph Troiullot, and/or Dipesh Chakrabarty.

This course will approach these problems through close readings of texts at the intersection of feminist psychoanalytic film theory, postcolonial theory, Black studies, and ethnic studies. While feminist film theory and psychoanalysis have had a robust intellectual encounter, both fields of study have been criticized for their lack of engagement with problems of colonial violence. In this seminar, we will explore what possibilities exist within these fields to address these absences. We will do so through a close attention to film's formal politics and its mediation of racial and sexual difference. Throughout, we will engage with a broad range of world cinema to test the utility of concepts beyond the boundaries of classical Hollywood. Assignments will include two short reading responses and a final paper. In addition to key texts from Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan, course readings can include: Joan Copjec, Frantz Fanon, Ranjana Khanna, Homay King, David Marriott, Todd McGowan, Kaja Silverman, Kalpana Seshadri, Hortense Spillers, and Slavoj ?i?ek.

    "ClassOverview": "One of the many questions raised by the recent Covid-19 pandemic, concerns the notion of. community and more specifically, its relation to the kinds of separation and distancing imposed by it. This course seeks to respond to this situation by returning to a discussion started in the 1980s, mainly in France, about the continuing relevance or irrelevance of the notion of community, and related words, including communism, communion, communication. One of the distinctive aspects of the French discussion was that the notion of literature and more generally writing played an important role. The seminar proposes to return to the discussion between Jean-Luc Nancy and Maurice Blanchot concerning the notion of community, and its relation to literature (Nancy even writes of literary communism). Nancy continued to reflect on the possible relevance of this notion in the following decades, including his experience of the recent pandemic. At the core of the discussion is the question of what can form the basis of the common that is the root of all community as well as of the other words mentioned, and to what extent it necessarily implies an irreducible dimension of separation -- of which the experience of reading and writing literary texts might be an exemplary instance.",

Students learn to model large amounts of imperfect data using linear algebra, optimization and regularization techniques, and common physical sense.  Via lab exercises and homework, the course emphasizes application over theory. Exercises include but are not restricted to 1) locating events or objects from line-of-sight signal travel times, 2) de-blurring an image, 3) characterizing the subsurface from surface measurements of wave dispersion, 4) locating engineering structures from anomalous gravity data, and 5) tomography: non-destructive characterization of internal structure of materials, human bodies, or the Earth.  We will emphasize linear, discrete, ill-posed inverse problems, but will also review time series analysis, including Fourier Transforms and matched filtering, and touch on the principles of solving non-linear inverse problems via directed and random searches in model space.",

Is specialized training needed to critique an opera performance or museum exhibit? What explains the amounts paid for a musical festival ticket, screenplay rights, or a famous painting? Should we use tax dollars to develop and support creative industries, or should they rely on charitable donations and ticket sales? How have Internet improvements and digitalization changed the ways that books are published, films are released, and musical artists make a living? Who ultimately pays for television programs that are free to stream? Is copyright protection strong enough, and should authors encourage derivative works, such as fan fiction, song sampling, or video game mods? If pandemic concerns prohibit large audiences at Broadway shows or K-Pop concerts, how might promoters adapt? Does art exist in the presentation of culinary dishes or economics?",

We will study the behavior of individuals and firms in a world of limited resources, and the interactions between the two in many different markets. With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services? This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies.",

The broad goal will be to develop tools and criteria for evaluating and predicting economic outcomes. Asynchronous components: This class will be synchronous, with non-live viewing of lectures handled on a case-by-case basis. Students located in United States/Americas will be required to attend live, without exception. Also, there will be a strong groupwork component to this course, which will require coordinating time to work with other students.",

We begin by reviewing existing evidence on the answers to the following questions: How important are fluctuations in the modern U.S.? Why were fluctuations larger in the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century? Who gains and who suffers most because of fluctuations? How is inflation related to economic fluctuations? Why are fluctuations larger in developing economies than in developed economies? To understand the facts that we will document, we will consider modern general equilibrium theories of aggregate fluctuations. One important class of theories, Real Business Cycle theory, stresses the role of fluctuations in the rate of technology change. A different class of theories stresses the role of fluctuations in aggregate demand, including self-fulfilling changes in consumers' expectations. These theories have very different implications for optimal monetary and fiscal policy, which we will explore and evaluate. Finally, we will consider the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the economy.",

We will study the problems of cities, urban areas, and regions by examining the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance.

This course will present some of the basic ideas of game theory. The focus will be on the abstract concepts and their analysis rather than on the substance of the applications. While this course will not rely on wide knowledge of economics and will not use sophisticated mathematical techniques, it will be be fairly rigorous and will require an ability to follow closely reasoned arguments and solve problems.",

    "ClassOverview": "While examining the metaphor of the ecosystem in scholarship (holistic analysis, wholeness, interdependence, diversity, intersecting contexts etc.), the seminar will use texts from different parts of the planet to read and write about the representations of the natural world, especially as affected by human activities. What are the benefits of studying a literary text against the background of its production and in conversation with others with which it resonates? How can we be specific about our singular object of analysis without missing the bigger picture? How are energy flows, cycles, and sustainability represented in literary texts? How can we engage with literary texts about the environment beyond the classroom setting? How do we integrate environmental activist work in academic scholarship while remaining rigorous and objective? As we grapple with these questions, we will use different methods of reading literary and theoretical texts from an ecological perspective. We will also experiment with various methods of academic presentation.",

The broad goal of the course is to introduce students to the conventions and rigors of humanistic forms of evidence-based argumentation and analysis. We will accomplish this by focusing locally on the ways film style affects the treatment of key themes across Hitchcock's filmography: from mistaken identity and sexual politics to horror and voyeurism.",

    "ClassOverview": "Clarity of expression is no doubt valued in all communication.  But a newcomer to scholarly writing in all fields of study at Northwestern could be forgiven for wondering if many scholars' goal was in fact confusion if not downright opaqueness.  No matter what your major, you will read critical material by scholars writing from within the discipline, drawing on the methodologies particular to that discipline and on the specialized vocabulary in which arguments are crafted using those methodologies. These materials can read to a novice like the very antithesis of clarity!  And they can tempt a new reader not to fully engage with the argument and therefore potentially miss the point.For comparison and contrast, across the disciplines you will also read material considered to be for the general public (in The New York Times, The Economist, The Atlantic, for example). What is gained and what is lost when a complicated topic is translated from academic speak to plain prose?What does it mean to hone your skills of close reading?  It means reading carefully at the level of the sentence; tracing the argument through the sequence of paragraphs; and identifying the evidence - or lack of evidence - so central to any successful argument in all fields.This kind of reading enables sophisticated analysis and critique, the goal of this class for your writing as well as your contribution to class discussion.  As your close reading skills become more advanced, your participation in discussions and your own critical analysis in writing will advance.We will read scholarly material across the social sciences, sciences, and humanities, including quite a number of articles by Northwestern professors.  All material will be available electronically.",

In this course, we will study the culture, environment, and urban history of Chicagoland from the standpoint of Lake Michigan. Our attentions will range from the witnesses to the end of the last Ice Age to our own view of how climate change effects the Great Lakes. However, we'll focus especially on the history and culture of Chicago as it was shaped by proximity to the Lake, and how human decisions have shaped the lake in turn. Although this course is offered in the English department, it is a highly interdisciplinary course which includes readings drawn from literature, geography, history, architecture, journalism, and environmental studies. First-year students will gain a research-oriented introduction to study and life at Northwestern through the situation of its local cultural history and environment. Weather permitting, we will frequently hold class outdoors at the lakeside, and we may take excursions to notable coastal sites.",

    "ClassOverview": "From the Civil Rights Movement to the AIDS crisis to the legalization of gay marriage, LGBTQ art and activism have been deeply intertwined.  Queer writers in the U.S. have negotiated ever-shifting priorities and stigmas to represent queer life in literature and media. Stories have always been a way to have a voice, to account for oneself and one's community, and to connect to others who share one's experience. LGBTQ literature might be outward facing?representing queerness to a straight audience?or it might face inwards, speaking to a queer community of readers. Focusing on flashpoints in the history of LGBTQ rights and culture in the United States, this course will consider the relationship between activist movements and the art and literature produced within or around those movements. Is queer art by nature activist art? What does effective activism look like, and is art an effective form of it? What even counts as art (protest signs? rhyming chants? public displays of affection?) and, for that matter, what counts as activism? We will approach these questions with attention to literature and art as primary sources, as well as learning to attend carefully to historical context, changing norms, and queer vocabularies that have shifted over time.",

Our section will take a critical language awareness approach to writing that allows us to consider not only what is expected in academic writing, but the ideologies and value systems underlying those expectations and how expectations for language and writing vary across space and time.

    "ClassOverview": "Athletic sports - activities with no parallel in the rest of creation, writes the South African novelist John Maxwell Coetzee. In this class, we will be thinking about sports as a valid field of critical inquiry, worthy of careful and serious attention. We will approach sport as an institution in society with staggering cultural, social, and political power. We will ask the significance of sports to ideas of the self and the body as well as in broader cultural, social, economic, and political realms. We will ask, for example, how do we understand an athletic body that is trained to exceed beyond its physical limitation when it is subject to relentless scrutiny, surveillance, and regulations? Sports exist as a crucial cultural arena in which ideas around race, gender, sexuality, ability, and status are embodied, performed, and reconstructed. In this class, we will interrogate the ways in which sports have been culturally intertwined with and contributing to (toxic) masculinity and whiteness. Although sports have been a vital part of the American experience for the past 150 years, reading materials of this class cover a wide time span and do not focus exclusively on North America. We will be reading different genres of literature, ranging from nineteenth-century English athletic guidebooks for boyhood, to contemporary poetry by authors like Claudia Rankine, as well as collection of letters between Paul Auster and Coetzee.",

    "ClassOverview": "Coming-of-age novels and memoirs portray the journey from childhood to adulthood. In this course, we will focus on works of fiction and autobiography that pay special attention to the role that college plays in that journey. These works portray the formative childhood influences and conflicts that shape the protagonists. In the chapters on college, they dramatize the different ways that higher education helps the characters navigate the difficult and confusing task of taking control of their lives and coming to a deeper understanding of who they are and what they want from life. In each work, we also get to see the impact of their college experiences after the characters have graduated and entered the so-called real world. The works explore such questions as: Does college change who you are or, rather, help you to understand who you are? How does it impact your relationships with your family? What factors contribute to success in college and beyond, and what is even meant by success? Through reflection on and discussion, you'll begin to answer those and other questions for yourself too. We will read a variety of books that include: Bread Givers, a novel about a Jewish girl struggling with poverty at the turn of the 20th century; A Particular Kind of Black Man, a novel about the child of Nigerian immigrants who faces discrimination not only from white people but from African Americans; Educated, a memoir about a girl who grows up in an isolated, rural community with almost no formal education; and other literary works. In each work, college is a turning point for the main character, helping them to mature and move forward in their lives with clearer self-understanding and sense of purpose. The readings will offer you the opportunity not only to enjoy and discuss some wonderful books but also to reflect on the path that has led you to Northwestern and the ways you hope you will continue to grow and mature while you're here.",

    "ClassOverview": "Scholars of language and writing argue that language and its varieties, genres, modes, and rhetorical strategies are always shifting, flexible, and contested. Thus, sociolinguistic diversity?differences across and within languages and dialects?is inevitable. This seminar will explore how language difference is situated in current US and global discourses, considering language in written, spoken, and signed forms. We will disrupt monolingual ideologies that infiltrate those discourses, focusing on language diversity as an asset to individuals, cultures, and institutions. The course will consider college as one of those institutions and will explore language diversity and linguistic social justice as part of your first-year experience at Northwestern. Using scholarly readings from sociolinguistics and writing pedagogy along with popular non-fiction, the course will consider how we can sustain sociolinguistic diversity, how we can foster equity, access, and inclusion around language difference, and how our sociolinguistic diversity sustains us. You will formulate and explore your own questions about language diversity and linguistic justice in papers, presentations, and class discussions.Our seminar will operate as a community that celebrates our diverse language use and as a system of academic, practical, and emotional support as you begin your college experience. Students of all sociolinguistic backgrounds are welcome in this seminar, and our course design will provide direct benefits to students who identify as international, multilingual, and/or native speakers of non-mainstream Englishes.",

    "ClassOverview": "Every day on the Internet, on television, on the streets and in classrooms, we hear people expressing opinions about a variety of topics. The people who are most persuasive, however, are those who are most informed. This course is designed to give you the tools to develop an informed opinion about something that is important to you, to present that opinion to others orally and in writing, and to persuade others to consider (and even accept) your point of view. In other words, the seminar is designed to help you make the transition to a college mindset. We will begin the seminar by quickly exploring a few controversial topics, evaluating how well writers in both the scholarly and the popular press support their opinions and persuade audiences. In the process, you will learn how to evaluate sources, read critically, listen and consider opposing points of view, and develop a powerful response. Then you will have the opportunity to select a controversial topic of your choice and research it in depth, using library resources, the Internet, interviews, and surveys. In addition to learning research techniques, you will also learn techniques for presenting your ideas persuasively, both orally and in writing. By the end of the course, you will be in position to discuss your ideas in a thoughtful, authoritative way, becoming a more effective contributor in college classes as well as in conversations with family and friends.  In this sense, you will have earned the right to call yourself an expert on your topic.",

    "ClassOverview": "As you are well aware, being young has many benefits and many drawbacks. For instance, the optimism and creativity that often characterize youth can lead to positive social and societal change. At the same time, though, young people often struggle to be taken seriously, even when their actions and ideas are good ones. Through examining several historic and contemporary case studies, this course will explore both the triumphs and terrors of youth (i.e., teens-twenties). What risks are uniquely available to young people? Which ones are rewarded and which end in regret? How might these outcomes be mediated by other factors (e.g., race, gender, sexuality)? Most importantly, what can we learn from the triumphant and terrible behaviors of others? As we explore answers to these questions through discussion, reading, and writing assignments, we'll also take advantage of your own uniquely youthful status as first-quarter, first-year students. Specifically, we'll think and learn about how both your transition to college and the years ahead present you with opportunities to both capitalize on your youth and cultivate for you and others (especially those who might disparage Gen Z) a more realistic idea of what it really means to be young these days.",

This class will trace the evolution of literary representations of addiction across several centuries, from classical depictions of god-induced madness, through the Gothic narratives such as Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde, temperance classics such as Ten Nights in a Barroom (whose impact has often been compared to that of Uncle Tom's Cabin), to the twentieth- and twenty-first century comedies and confessionals that make the bestseller lists today. Through these readings and related critical texts, we will examine the ways that such literature provides a staging ground for public controversy and emerging theories about the artistic, cultural, ethical, and scientific significance and ramifications of addiction.Course readings/viewing will include works of fiction, journalism, and writings from the natural and social sciences as well as popular films. We will also consider practical topics such as how University library resources and experts can help students locate and evaluate key sources and develop authoritative arguments.",

A central goal of the class is to develop tools for approaching literary texts as creative expressions as well as challenging reflections on society, power, knowledge, and difference.  The millennium-long sweep of English 210 will help us appreciate literature not as leisure reading but as challenging, bold, funny, even utopian political thought articulated through new representational forms.The class is structured in units with key texts accompanied by corollary short documents aimed to illuminate the text's historical and literary meanings.  Central readings (some excerpted) include:  Beowulf; Geoffrey Chaucer, Canterbury Tales; Thomas More, Utopia; William Shakespeare, The Tempest and sonnets; John Donne, Andrew Marvell, poems; John Milton, Paradise Lost; Aphra Behn, Oroonoko; Eliza Haywood, Fantomina; Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels; Olaudah Equiano, Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African.",

    "ClassOverview": "After asserting its manifest destiny in the nineteenth century, the United States became an unprecedented global power in the twentieth century, especially after World War II. In 1941, the publisher Henry Luce went so far as to coin the phrase the American century to describe the new role of the emerging superpower in world affairs. For some, the US became the indispensable nation, world leader, and an exceptional international figure. For many others, such as the people of the Philippines or Vietnam or Iraq, it became a cruel and coercive imperial force. This course studies how the historical fact of US empire influenced literature and expressive culture. We will examine how both domestic and international writers most impacted by imperial violence?such as Filipino migrant laborers, the descendants of interned Japanese-Americans, or Afghani and Pakistani diaspora in the US?contest the language of empire that the U.S. used to define itself. What kinds of stories, prison memoirs, protest poems, graphic novels, and other aesthetic forms have emerged out of the desire for more truthful counter-narratives? How has the geography of United States empire shaped and informed the multiracial experience of both its populations and those abroad?While the course thinks through Asian American and postcolonial diaspora in South Asia and the so-called Middle East, it also encourages students to think about US imperial effects in Latin America and the Caribbean. Throughout the term, students will be introduced to and learn to grapple with complex theoretical and historical concepts like settler colonialism, Cold War militarism, post-9/11 counterinsurgency, extraterritorial internment, and neoliberal hegemony. Along the way, we will ask large questions about the function of literature such as: what makes a work of art political? What kinds of aesthetic strategies do writers and artists use in their presentation of the political? What does it mean for literature to be performing resistance? Assignments will include one close-reading paper, one theoretical reading paper, pop quizzes, robust sections participation, and a final exam.",

    "ClassOverview": "Practical Rhetoric is a discussion-based course designed to prepare incoming tutors at the Writing Place the practical skills and pedagogical theories behind effective peer-to-peer tutoring in writing centers. The class is practical in that it centers on in-class writing workshops that simulate interactions you are likely to experience during your tutoring work. The course also focuses heavily on both classic and current theories of the teaching of writing and of writing center-specific pedagogies. We will introduce you to classic works of writing center theory while also asking you to engage in more contemporary debates and studies in the field. Through a combination of reading about writing center pedagogies and practicing teaching each other writing in the classroom, Practical Rhetoric seeks to: prepare you to effectively coach writers at all stages of the writing process; cultivate the necessary skills to work productively and compassionately with writers from different backgrounds and for whom English is not their first language; and provide resources and techniques for working on papers and genres of writing outside of your majors and comfort zones.In the spirit of the collaborative writing process that is at the heart of the Writing Place's mission, as writers this quarter, this course will ask you to regularly bring your own writing to class to workshop in a series of mock consultations and writing exercises with your classmates. You will reflect on your own positionality as a writer-- and consider what that positionality brings to your work at the Writing Place-- in a personal literacy narrative. We will ask you to contribute to the work of writing center studies through your own research project, ideally on a topic or initiative that you can continue developing and perhaps even put into action in later quarters to improve and grow our services at the Writing Place. Lastly, the course asks you to visit the Writing Place as writers yourselves, reflecting on what your experiences as the student being tutored teach you about yourself as both a tutor and a writer.In addition to completing all of the graded elements of this course, students enrolled in Practical Rhetoric are required to work for at least 3 hours/week in the Writing Place. You will be paid for these (and any additional weekly hours) you work.",

    "ClassOverview": "Much of writing is made up of obsessions. We might use our obsession as catalyst and fuel, something that gets us writing and, if lucky, keeps us writing. And sometimes we write about our obsession directly, hoping (perhaps futilely) to be purged free of it, once and for all. Susan Sontag, while talking about writing and the writer's life, said it simply: You have to be obsessed. It's not something you'd want to be?it's rather something you couldn't help but be. In this course we'll explore obsession from two main angles: personally and textually. On the personal level, and as a way to get us started, we'll discuss and identify subjects we keep returning to?from harmless infatuations to downright obsessions. Is Kendrick Lamar, Lizzo or the soundtrack from Mama Mia playing nonstop on your headphones, for example? Is there a painting you keep seeing in your mind's eye? What exactly is your relationship with a well-made cheeseburger? What is the chronic conflict of your life? On a textual level, we'll read stories, essays, and books that deal with obsession in one form or another, or reveal the linguistic obsessions the author held while writing them.Students will have the option to write a creative non-fiction essay or a short story. This class is for serious writers who are unafraid of taking real risks, unafraid of true rewrites/revisions, unafraid of working hard toward turning a good story or an essay into a great one.",

Essentially litmus tests of social feeling, these plays reflect on the slow dismantling of empire, demographic shifts, strained or nascent institutions, and political regime change in brilliant expos?s of national character. More recently, this genre has also been used to register the project of cultural pluralism (and its discontents) and Britain's place in the world. Because the plays are staged, they provide outstanding ways to examine narrative and metaphor's reception in a constantly changing political landscape.",

Dunham came of age in the milieu of the Chicago Renaissance, collaborating with Black and white artists to create a new style of dancing based on her ethnographic research in the Caribbean. During the years surrounding World War II she made a national reputation performing with her company on Broadway and on the Hollywood screen. Then in the decades following the war, she traveled internationally with her company, her work implicitly and explicitly engaging the Civil Rights Movement and the struggle for decolonization. In 1965 Dunham settled in East St. Louis, where she trailblazed methods for using the arts to engage and uplift youth in the community. The class time will be split between movement and discussion. In addition to guest teachers in Dunham technique, students in this course will encounter the full range of primary sources for dance studies?film and video, oral history and memoir, unpublished manuscripts and correspondence, exhibitions of visual material, digital databases. There will also be several co-curricular outings integrated into this course?from an exhibit at the Newberry Library to a panel at the Modernist Studies Association.

The second unit will focus on travel literature. We'll read the Itinerary of William of Rubruck (ca. 1250), one of the first Europeans to visit the court of the Great Khan in the Mongol Empire, along with the best-selling Travels of Sir John Mandeville (1360s), an armchair traveler whose open-minded curiosity makes him a model of premodern ethnography. Finally, we will explore the versatile genre of the framed story collection, reading portions of the Thousand and One Nights, Boccaccio's Decameron, and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.",

Shakespeare himself fell into some of these categories of otherness; as actors without fixed social status, so did his colleagues; so for that matter did his Queen.  Subsequent readers and interpreters of Shakespeare have found in his representations of other identities much to praise and much to question, but they have found common material to think with.  Given Shakespeare's unique status within anglophone and world literatures, Shakespeare's writings are rich ground for posing questions of otherness, identity, and empathy, belonging, commonness, and difference.  In this class we will take up some of the cues Shakespeare's plays provide, their insights and oversights, and investigate how Shakespeare, and others, responded to them.",

This class will consider Jane Austen's development as a writer, in the context of the culture wars in Britain in the 1790s, in the wake of the French Revolution. Is Austen a radical or conservative novelist? Does she defend the values of a dying aristocracy, or champion a new middle class sensibility? How does she respond to the jarring changes affecting her society? Does she assert the privileges of the governing classes or urge the rights of silenced groups (especially young women)? Does she offer a traditional or progressive view of marriage? Should children make their own choices in marriage or defer to parental authority? How do her novels cultivate good judgment? Do the arts have a progressive role in transforming society or a conservative one in maintaining traditional values? These are some of the questions we will examine as we read a range of her novels. Our goal will be to understand the experimental and fluid nature of Austen's thought, as well as the way in which she transformed the history of the novel.",

    "ClassOverview": "It is said that the Victorians invented the idea of childhood: an idyllic state of wonder, play, imagination, and innocence. The orphans, adventurers, tricksters, and runaways in Victorian children's novels befriend animals, outsmart pirates, soar through the London sky, and fall down rabbit holes. What made these stories so popular in the nineteenth century, and why do they continue to enchant readers today? This course will explore key works of the Victorian literature canon to consider how these various narratives reflect rapidly transforming conceptions of childhood during the nineteenth century. From Lewis Carroll's playfully puzzling Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to Rudyard Kipling's novel of colonial espionage, Kim, Victorian children's novels offer a unique perspective on a world in the grip of profound political, economic, and religious change. As we read, we will also reflect on the categories of the human and the animal, the nature of child sexuality, the distinctions drawn between innocence and maturity, as well as differences in gender, race, class, and disability. How does the constructed representation of the child speak to the desires, ambitions, and anxieties of a given historical moment? And what does the very category of children's literature suggest about literature's purpose and value?",

This course will introduce students to twentieth and twenty-first century South Asian Literatures in English characterized by exciting stylistic innovations in magical realism, modernist language games, lyrical prose, and biting satire. By examining novels, short stories, poems, political writing, and films, we will ask, how has literature shaped both the promise and failure of the postcolonial nation-state?

During the cultural crisis of Modernism, when a variety of intellectual revolutions and the unprecedented carnage of the Great War suggested that Western civilization was either a sham or doomed, writers and other artists created new literary forms. Their aesthetic innovation often depicted art and love (or sex) as parallel (or contradictory) ways to create meaning the wasteland of Modernity.

Yet, as disability theorists have observed, western literature has long been obsessed with disability as metaphor, character trait, and plot device. This course will serve as an introduction to the application of disability studies in literature. We will explore a range of questions: how do we approach the representation of disability in texts by non-disabled authors? How do we differentiate (or should we?) between disability and chronic illness, or between physical and mental disabilities? Can literary representation operate as activism? How do we parse the gap between disability as metaphor and lived experience? What does literature offer disability studies, and why should disability studies be a core method for studying literature?  This is a methods class, and readings will be divided between theoretical texts and primary sources. Students will learn to grapple with complex sociocultural and literary analysis, as well as to make space for their own primary source readings.",

    "ClassOverview": "This selective-enrollment, yearlong Sequence is designed to make students increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry.  The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry?including description, rhetoric, story and song?and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and imitation assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of Daily Poems, thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others' work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.",

We'll be looking at, discussing, writing about, commenting on, and researching the elements of fiction, but mostly what we'll be doing is writing buckets (you will be turning in a completed piece every other week during the Fall quarter), so we'll be reading mostly to steal: we'll figure out what works and we'll use it for our own material. We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you'll get.",

Writing?poetry, drama, narrative?is made of other writing, and all writers mine their predecessors for material to vary and to reconfigure.  Sometimes readers are meant to recognize a source to see how it has been transformed or preserved; sometimes borrowings and responses are only for the writer.  Literary theft can be homage or parody or both at once.  Most practically, literary imitation allows a work to include more than is given on the page.  In this research-oriented course, we will explore what it means to build a literary work from other works.  We will consider examples of imitative and creative reworking at the level of word, form, and plot, from the Renaissance, one of the most eager and dynamic periods of literary imitation, and beyond.  Students will design further readings based on their research.  We will also develop research strategies for writing a longer paper, and students will undertake a significant research project on a text of their choice that draws some of its energies from other works.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course for writers of fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction focuses on the contexts and processes of creative writing.  Our multi-genre readings enact or exemplify or think or imply something about how what we write develops out of our social, intellectual and artistic formation, intellectual curiosity, psychic processes, emotional investments, sense of language, and artistic goals. Readings will broaden our sense of how writers discover and develop their materials, techniques, and reshape their artistic goals as they work?in the way that the work of writing itself can shift the writer's sense of the work and of the writer's purposes. We'll examine how the complexity of writing from one body of experience and thought may lead not to a style but to a range of possible structures, stances, and processes of writing. We'll draw examples, methods and artistic positions from our readings in order to expand our ability to think about (and perhaps begin) new possible projects and?just as important?new ways of working on existing projects. Writing assignments will be unlike those you may have previously completed.  This is not a creative writing workshop.Readings (many of these are brief) will be late 20th and early 21st century writers, including some of the following: Julia ?lvarez, James Baldwin, Christopher Bollas, Julia de Burgos, Helene Cixous, Lucille Clifton, V?ctor Hern?ndez Cruz, Mahmoud Darwish, Robert Duncan, William Goyen, Kimiko Hahn, Amy Hempel, Danilo Ki?, Clarice Lispector, Ed Roberson, Katherine Mansfield, Linda McCarriston, Leonard Michaels, Marga Minco, Toni Morrison, Lorine Neidecker, Grace Paley, Sterling Plumpp, Adrienne Rich, Yannis Ritsos, Angela Jackson, Richard Wright, Jenny Xie or others.",

Beginning with nineteenth- and early twentieth-century debates about historical materialism and the uses of history and literary history as disciplines, we will survey the development and invocations of historicism as an approach to literary study across colonial, imperial, modernist, postcolonial, and environmental episodes in literary history. How does historicism fare in addressing diverse periods? For example, while British Victorian studies recently faced critiques of dominant tendencies toward positivist historicism, some of the most energizing work in postcolonial literary studies has been deeply historicist in inclination. How has climate change provoked new visions of historical time crossing the traditional periods? Must we continue to follow Jameson's famous injunction to always historicize! or do we rather find ourselves in a weak theoretical state of affairs by which we cannot not historicize? How do we understand Roland Barthes's claim that a little formalism turns one away from History, but ? a lot brings one back to it? What is historicism good for? What are its varieties? Where does it fall short? Readings may include works by G.W.F. Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hayden White, Susan Buck-Morss, Fredric Jameson, Walter Benjamin, Antonio Gramsci, Saidiya Hartman, Reinhart Koselleck, Sianne Ngai, Michael Denning, Sylvia Wynter, Lisa Lowe, Michel-Rolph Troiullot, and/or Dipesh Chakrabarty.

    "ClassOverview": "Frantz Fanon has famously written that the conditions of modernity have rendered blackness increasingly illegible, fraught with contradictions that push it outside the realm of facile comprehension and explicability. Taking Fanon's polemic as a cue, this graduate seminar will look at a number of late twentieth-century textual and performance sites with radical instances of experimentation where articulations of blackness move into the interstitial space between meaning and non-meaning, coming into being precisely at the moment when the compositional logic of their anticipated forms are ruptured. The course will focus on three primary sites where black artists engage what might be called the poetics of dissolution to examine and critique the processes of racial formation: poetry (where the form of the line or stanza dissolves); music (where sonic interpolations puts additional, if not different, claims on the lyrical content), and visual culture (where the moves toward graphic mimesis are refused delineation). The material under consideration may include work by the poets Nathaniel Mackey and Harriet Mullen; turntablists DJ Spooky, Jazzy Jeff, and Premier; songs by musicians from Ella Fitzgerald to MF Doom; and pieces by visual artists Kara Walker and Glenn Ligon. Theoretical texts may include work by Barthes, Baudrillard, Moten, and Saussure, as well as ethnomusicologists and linguistic anthropologists.",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar will reexamine two commonplaces in the history of the British novel: that early prose narrative was driven by the rise of empiricism and observational science; and that Restoration and eighteenth-century prose forms led straight to the representational mode known as realism. We begin the seminar by querying accounts of the rise of the New Science based on its strict privileging of sensory data and refusal of imperceptible or occult causes. Along with alternative accounts of embodied artisanal knowledge and micromatter, we will also ponder environmental determinism (which antedates the concept of biological race) and the structuring mandates of empire, extraction, and exploitation. The seminar will then confront the constitutive near-repression of the history of the slave trade in the long eighteenth-century archive, which will enable us critically to appraise dominant conceptions of the eighteenth-century real and attune us to speculative and/ or recuperative interventions in that reality's textual consolidation through the present day. For the rest of the seminar, we will read prose narratives to ponder the strategies through which they claim to represent the real, with special attention to empirical perception and its limits. Are these texts' representational, formal, and political claims based solely on phenomenal experience, plenitude of naturalistic detail, or verisimilitude? Can we locate other, even anti-realist modes through which eighteenth-century prose forms transmit meaning?",

How do minority writers represent the asymmetrical effects of toxic exposure, crumbling infrastructure, and resource extraction? How might we think of race itself as ecologically constituted? To begin answering these questions, this graduate seminar will survey African American, Native American, Asian American, and Latinx novels, short stories, poetry, and film that explore the differential effects of what Anna Tsing calls blasted landscapes on minoritized populations. Concurrently, we will articulate an ecological approach to race, i.e., an interdisciplinary methodology drawing from critical race theory, Ethnic Studies, environmental studies, and posthumanism. Rather than seeing racial justice as a secondary concern to environmental crises, our discussions will highlight how race is always fundamentally imbricated in ecology. This unorthodox approach to racial representation will also push us towards formulations of comparative racialization, as we consider, for example, ecological entanglements of U.S. imperialism in Asia and Latin America. Finally, we will examine how art and literature imagine possibilities for minority resilience and flourishing. The class will pressure critical terms and paradigms such as representation, ethics, ecology, environment, risk, nature, and infrastructure.",

    "ClassOverview": "Environmental problems have become part and parcel of popular consciousness: resources are being depleted at a record pace, human population levels just crossed the seven billion threshold, extreme poverty defines the majority of people's daily lives, toxic contaminants affect all ecosystems, increasing numbers of species face extinction, consumerism and the commodification of nature show no signs of abating, climate changes are wreaking havoc in different places every year, and weapons and energy systems continue to proliferate that risk the planet's viability. This introductory lecture course is designed to help students understand the relatively recent origins of many of these problems, focusing especially on the last one hundred and fifty years. Students will have an opportunity to learn about the environmental effects of urbanization, industrialization, population growth, market economies, empire-building, intercontinental warfare, energy extraction, and new technologies. They will also explore different environmental philosophies and analytic frameworks that help us make sense of historical change, including political ecology, environmental history, science studies, and world history. Finally, the course will examine a range of transnational organizations, social movements, and state policies that have attempted to address and resolve environmental problems. This year, we will also explore questions of environmental health, disease ecologies, spillover events, and Covid-19.",

The key concepts, debates, and approaches in this field address two main questions: (1) How do humans' interactions with the environment shape power and politics? (2) How do power and politics shape humans' interactions with the environment? These questions are critical to understanding and addressing the current issues of climate change, the Anthropocene, and environmental justice. Topics discussed in this class will include environmental scarcity and degradation, sustainability and conservation, and environmental justice. Readings will come from the disciplines of geography, anthropology and archaeology. Case studies will range from the historical to the present-day. No prior background in the environmental sciences is needed to appreciate and engage in this course.",

These issues have contributed to tension between Native and non-Native communities and have become the subject of news reports, in both mainstream and tribal media. We will focus on how the media cover these issues and how that coverage contributes to the formation of public opinion and public policy.

    "ClassOverview": "Global environmental problems, including the looming threat of climate change, the biodiversity crisis, and increasing pressures on ocean ecosystems due to human activities, have become pressing concerns in recent decades. In response, a sophisticated architecture of global governance has emerged, including through the establishment of hundreds of multi-lateral treaties to confront these threats. As a consequence, nation-States have begun to cooperate with each other to an unprecedented extent, although not without facing significant obstacles, and not without domestic political agendas sometimes delaying or thwarting progress at the international level. This class examines the array of legal regimes, politics, governance processes and policy tools that have emerged in the arena of global environmental law and politics. We will focus on a number of different discrete international environmental problems, as well as how international environmental law is formulated and enforced at the international level.Assignments will include drafting of UN resolutions and simulated UN General Assembly debates and a mid-term examination. There will also be substantial small-group work to engage in interpretation of treaties.",

The class will cover laws pertaining to religious freedoms and how they are applied to Native and non-Native contexts throughout U.S. history, along with the histories and philosophies that have, and still influences these polices.The class will cover both Federal and Tribal management of sacred sites, ceremonial sites, and religious/spiritual traditions. Important to this discuss, will be the role of oral history in the preservation of culture and relationships to landscapes and how it has/is being utilized the U.S. legal system pertaining to Native American Tribes. The role of treaties and the conflicts that arise between Tribal/U.S. government to government relations and responsibilities will also be covered.",

Why are we attracted to bad or frightening characters? What is the function of pain or illness in the moral, social, and political perspectives that literary texts propose? How does gender shape the portrayal of evil in fiction? This course will focus on close reading and the development of critical writing skills. All lectures and readings will be in French.",

This seminar explores Montaigne's writings in depth, along with those of his most important interlocutors, in the context of the emergence of modern subjectivity in the period we call Renaissance. Placing the distant past into conversation with the present, we will consider a set of problems relative to the constitution of the self, of the body, of cultural and gender identity, educational ideals, and political freedom. We will explore the rise of cultural norms surrounding death, love, friendship, faith, and violence. Montaigne's writings are a gateway into a turbulent and transformative period of history, one which has much to say to our own.",

The languages spoken or the actors who play the roles? Do national cinemas have distinct visual styles?and if so, how does that sit with the idea that cinema is somehow a universal language?In this course we will explore debates about the national and/or global dimensions of cinema, from some of the classic texts of early film theory to such recent films such as Parasite. Following a series of readings on the concepts of cinema and the nation, we will study the global circulation of ideas about the films of the great director Yasujiro Ozu, routinely said to be the most Japanese of all filmmakers, but also an influence on directors throughout the world. In our longest unit, we will explore the idea of new wave cinemas. Originally used to describe innovative French films of the late 50s and 60s, new wave became both a critical and a marketing concept to group films from Japan, Poland, Iran, and many other countries around the world, to the present day.We will watch, read about, and discuss by a wide range of films from around the world, with an emphasis on Western Europe and East Asia. Beyond Ozu, directors may include Sergei Eisenstein, Claire Denis, Wim Wenders, Edward Yang, Abbas Kiraostami, Abderrahmane Sissako, Bong Joon-ho, and Lee Isaac Chung.",

    "ClassOverview": "Women Writing in French : Postwar France through Marguerite DurasMarguerite Duras was one of the most prolific, influential, and controversial writers in 20th century France. In her lengthy career (1943-1996), Duras composed a creative corpus spanning the modernist and postmodernist eras and comprising works of journalism, theatre, short stories, a children's story, realist, experimental, and postmodern writings, fictionalized autobiographies, film scenarios and films. She understood writing and other artistic processes as sites of formal and intellectual experimentation, transgression, and discovery; processes through which one might discover new values for use--or not-- after the revolution. Deeply entwined with her social and political thought, Duras's work forms a sustained response to the rapidly transforming social, cultural and political contexts from which it emerged, of which this class focuses on the following: World War II, the camps, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki; French colonialism, decolonization, rising immigration and colonial nostalgia; postwar Marxist and psychoanalytic feminist thought, and issues of education. In addition to Duras's work, we will read and present on these contexts, permitting us to gain a sense of both the historical eras in question and of Duras's creative responses to them. Our work will include video screenings outside of class, on a schedule to be determined in our first meeting.",

    "ClassOverview": "Global health is a popular field of work and study for Americans, with an increasing number of medical trainees and practitioners, as well as people without medical training, going abroad to volunteer in areas where there are few health care practitioners or resources. In addition, college undergraduates, as well as medical trainees and practitioners, are going abroad in increasing numbers to conduct research in areas with few healthcare resources. But all of these endeavors, though often entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas, and can have unintended consequences. In this course, students will explore and consider these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core global bioethical concerns - such as structural violence - and core global bioethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as beneficence and solidarity - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the central goal of global health: reducing health inequities and disparities. With an emphasis on the ethical responsibility to reduce disparities, we consider some of the most pressing global bioethical issues of our time: equity, fairness, and climate change. Particular attention is given to the ethics of research during a pandemic and access to vaccines and therapies for Covid-19.",

We will explore contemporary illness experiences and therapeutic interventions in sociocultural and historical context through case studies from the US, Brazil, and South Africa. Students will be introduced to key concepts such as embodiment, medicalization, structural violence, the social determinants of health, and biopolitics. Central questions of the seminar include: How do social categories of difference determine disease and health in individuals and collectivities? How is medical science influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient mobilization? How does social and economic inclusion/exclusion govern access to treatment as well as care of the self and others? The course will provide advanced instruction in anthropological and related social scientific research methods as they apply to questions of social inequality and public health policy in both the United States and in emerging economic powers.

    "ClassOverview": "Since the early 2000s, there has been an exponential increase in the number of foreigners volunteering in low-income communities, within orphanages, clinics, schools, and communities. This expansion has been echoed by locals, who are also providing voluntary labor in a variety of locales throughout their communities. This class explores the discourses and practices that make up volunteering and voluntourism, from the perspectives of volunteers, hosts, and a range of professional practitioners both promoting and critiquing this apparent rise in the need to help. What boons and burdens occur with the boom of volunteer fervor world-wide? Why do people feel the need to volunteer, and what consequences do these voluntary exchanges have on the volunteers, and on those communities and institutions that are subject to their good intentions? What are the ethics and values that make up making a difference amongst differently-situated players who are involved in volunteering? Given that volunteers often act upon best intentions, what are the logics that justify philanthropy and the differential standards by which volunteers are judged based on where they go and how they engage in volunteering? This class seeks out some answers to these questions, and highlights why the increased concern for strangers that undergirds volunteering should also be, in itself, cause for our concern.",

Our focus will be on human reproduction, considering the vantage points of both healthcare practitioners and lay women and men. We will look at ideas concerning fertility, conception, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, birth control, abortion, and assisted reproduction. Because, at a fundamental level, reproduction is about power - as historian Amy Kaler (but by no means only Kaler), pointed out, [c]ontrol over human reproduction is eternally contested, in zones ranging from the comparative privacy of the conjugal bedroom to the political platform and programs of national polities - we will pay attention to power in reproductive health. And, since the distribution of power in matters of reproduction has often been uneven and unequal - between men and women, between colonizing and Indigenous populations, between clinicians and lay people, between those in upper socioeconomic classes and those in lower socioeconomic classes - we will pay particular attention during this class to struggles over matters of reproduction as we explore historical changes and continuities in reproduction globally since 1900.",

Healthcare workers, and physicians and nurses in particular, have long held sway in the popular imagination as heroes, villains, and even complicated anti-heroes. What can we learn about the societal values we place on medicine (and medical personnel) by exploring the ways that medical heroes and villains are depicted to wide public audiences (or the ways they write about themselves)? What do these fictional and non-fictional accounts have to tell us about societal celebrations, anxieties and ambiguities relating to medicine? How might we contemplate the ways societal norms relating to race, gender, sexuality, place of origin, ability, and other identifiers become mapped onto the stories the public consumes relating to medicine? What can these stories tell us about anxieties regarding life and death, technology, science, and culture? Who is portrayed as hero, who as villain, who as victim, and who as backdrop to the narrative? What perspectives are often silenced or left in the backdrop in these popularly-consumed narratives about medicine? In this course, we will read and view fictional, dramatized, and non-fiction narratives aimed at wide public audiences. In so doing, we will use medicine as a lens on a wide array of societal ambiguities, potentialities, inequalities and silences.NOTE: Students will be exposed to some stories and cases they may find disturbing.",

Black bodies, for example, are often the tied to (un)health because they are stereotyped as in need to be controlled, managed, and guided into healthfulness. And in the U.S., these are just a few of the terms that define Black bodies. Guide by such questions such as, How does culture define health?, How does the food pipeline affect the health of certain bodies? and What does it mean to live in an obesogenic environment? in this course, we examine the connection between health, culture, food, and environment with a focus on what is silenced and what is loud when generating fixes for diseased bodies. Silence refers to the disregard and dismissiveness of the narratives and experiences around the oppressions attached to the health of certain bodies. Yet, this silence echoes as Loud when connected to their culture, food, environment when discussing diseases highlighted in Black bodies such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.",

But what does it mean, exactly, to lie - or, if not exactly to lie, to seek to overpower the person you are talking to with a stream of empty rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, deflection, bluffing, or other modes of deceptive or manipulative speech? To what ends have such practices been put throughout history, and what are their political, social, and psychological consequences? This seminar will look at the practice and implications of various forms of deceptive or coercive speech in a selection of novels, films, essays, and philosophical texts. Possible readings may include: Arthur Schopenhauer, The Art of Being Right; Friedrich Nietzsche, On Truth and Lying in an Extra-moral Sense; Orson Welles, F for Fake; Patricia Highsmith, The Talented Mr. Ripley; and Hannah Arendt, Lying in Politics.",

Berlin's extremely eventful history has been described and reflected in a multitude of literary texts, film, visual arts, and music. Based on its current cultural and historical situation, the course aims at uncovering layer by layer significant stages of the city's history: Berlin as the capital of the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, as the divided city of the Cold War and the capital of the Berlin Republic after Germany's reunification. Drawing on a wide range of media, from maps through film to music and literature, sudents will identify specific features of the respective historic constellations and explore how the 20th century affects life in 21st century Berlin. Finally, by taking a closer look at today's Berlin with its ruptures and its ability of ever reinventing itself, we will give special attention to representations of Berlin's intricate social structure, which is reflective of the changing face of national culture, and to questions of migration and mobility, marginalization and gentrification.",

For more than five-hundred years the legend of Faust has served as means to express the daring and danger of pursuing an aspiration even if it comes at the cost of one's soul. The specter of a Faustian bargain often appears when narratives identify individuals whose inordinate achievements are both destructive and self-destructive.  The theme of Faust provides a perspective in which one must thus reflect on the highest and lowest values.Dr. Faustus has undergone many mutations since he first appeared in central Europe around the early sixteenth century.  This class will begin with a question at the foundation of the Faust legend:  what is a soul, and what is worth?   While examining these and kindred questions about the nature of the self, the class will continually reflect on what we are doing when we evaluate a work of art in relation to the culture of its time or period.  In addition to listening to some musical compositions and reading some shorter texts, we will examine the earliest versions of Faust, which derives from the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation and then proceed to read Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's great drama of cosmic knowledge and sexual seduction, Faust I, followed by selections from its strange sequel Faust II, in which Faust invents paper money and then becomes a real-estate developer or social-engineer who wants to reorganize the very nature of our planet.  We will ask what Goethe, near the end of his life, gave to world literature (a term of his own invention) when he presented his final version of Faust as a man committed to a total terrestrial transformation that inadvertently destroys innocent lives.  As a conclusion to our analysis of Goethe's Faust, we will read two very different kinds of poetic responses, Paul Celan's Death Fugue and Carol Ann Duffy's Mrs. Faust.  And in the final two weeks of the class we will view three versions of the Faust legend for our times, beginning with the story of the bluesman Robert Johnson, as represented in Peter Meyer's Can't You Hear the Wind Howl?, followed by Sophie Barthes' Cold Souls and concluding with Danny Boyle's Yesterday.",

In this context we will examine fiction, autobiography, poetry, and political and theoretical writings by and about minority voices in Germany in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Questions we will explore include: What is the relationship between autobiographical writing and identity? What is a minority and how might we conceive of a minority literature in a manner that is critical to identitarian claims of ethnicity, religious belief, gender, and class? What role does minority literature play in Germany?",

    "ClassOverview": "In 1945, Germany was in ruins. The defeat of the Nazis had physically destroyed Germany's infrastructure, morally delegitimized its institutions, and divided its diminished territory into a capitalist West and a socialist East. The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) represented two experiments of how to create the ideal society, and the German-German border, vividly symbolized by the BerlinWall, quickly became a central site of the Cold War. This course examines those two states and the solutions they developed to common challenges, including re-civilizing committed Nazis, confronting the memory of the Holocaust, reconstructing a shattered economy, combatting terrorism, managing migration, and addressing environmental degradation. How did these two societies re-civilize in the wake of global war and genocide? How is it that this ruined land of 1945 could become, within fifty years, the richest and most stable nation in Europe?",

    "ClassOverview": "One of the many questions raised by the recent Covid-19 pandemic, concerns the notion of. community and more specifically, its relation to the kinds of separation and distancing imposed by it. This course seeks to respond to this situation by returning to a discussion started in the 1980s, mainly in France, about the continuing relevance or irrelevance of the notion of community, and related words, including communism, communion, communication. One of the distinctive aspects of the French discussion was that the notion of literature and more generally writing played an important role. The seminar proposes to return to the discussion between Jean-Luc Nancy and Maurice Blanchot concerning the notion of community, and its relation to literature (Nancy even writes of literary communism). Nancy continued to reflect on the possible relevance of this notion in the following decades, including his experience of the recent pandemic. At the core of the discussion is the question of what can form the basis of the common that is the root of all community as well as of the other words mentioned, and to what extent it necessarily implies an irreducible dimension of separation -- of which the experience of reading and writing literary texts might be an exemplary instance.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: To Paint Their LivesThis seminar will focus on how women, across cultures and time, represent their lives through various media and means, from visual art to literary engagements to graphic media, from movies and photography to music and social media. Our interdisciplinary investigation of (mostly non-Western) women's autobiographical practices, past and present, will allow us to work closely with primary sources (in English translation, if necessary), and with pertinent theoretical work in the fields of gender, sexuality, feminist theory, and queer studies.The authors we will engage include Sarashina, Artemisia Gentileschi, Li Qingchao, Lady Hyegyong, Orgyan Chokyi, Zora Neale Hurston, Charlotte Salomon, Theresa H. K. Cha, Rigoberta Menchu', Trinh Minh-ha, Audre Lorde, Marjane Satrapi, Keum Suk Gendry-Kim and Thi Buy, among others. When possible and meaningful, we will set their autobiographical practices against the grain of male representations of women's lives, and in dialogue with our own autobiographical gestures and utterances.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Intersectionality & Coalitional PoliticsWhat does it mean to describe race, gender, sexuality, and class as intersecting identities or categories? What new forms of knowledge and ways of knowing, political tools and ways of doing politics does this insight make possible? And how can we use these to make sense of and respond to the urgencies of the present moment? In this seminar we will focus on intersectionality as a mode of feminist critical inquiry and activist practice (or critical praxis) forged by Black feminists. As Patricia Hill Collins explains, The term intersectionality references the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability, and age operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities. Together we will read foundational texts by Collins and other Black feminist scholars and activists to understand and explore this critical insight and the coalitional politics that an intersectional analysis both demands and makes possible. We will pair these readings with collective research into both past and present projects that engage this form of Black feminist critical praxis to respond to complex social inequalities, including Black Lives Matter, the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, and the Poor People's Campaign.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Paris Noir in the 20th CenturyIn 1924, when the African-American poet Langston Hughes arrived in Paris, hungry with only seven dollars in his pocket, he ran up the Champs Elys?es in the snow, thrilled to see the Arc de Triomphe in the distance. In Montmartre where he eventually found a job as a busboy and occasional bouncer, he consoled Ada Bricktop Smith, the singer and dancer from New York who owned of the most popular jazz club in the neighborhood and for whose attention Cole Porter and F. Scott Fitzgerald competed. Soon, Josephine Baker (originally from St. Louis, Missouri) would shock and delight audiences with her Revue N?gre to become the most celebrated entertainer in Paris. While state-side, newspapers dubbed this community, the Harlem Renaissance Overseas, Black and Brown artists, intellectuals, students, journalists and other sojourners from the United States encountered another exotic in Paris: their own counter-parts from the Caribbean and Africa. Out of this engagement, a multi-lingual diasporic identity developed within a new internationalism. It birthed the N?gritude movement and fostered an anti-colonial nationalist opposition that would lead de-colonization struggles in the 1950s and ?60s. This seminar invites students to explore this extraordinary flowering of artistic and political expression. Over the quarter, we will study the Afro-diasporic poetry, novels, painting, photography, film, music, and dance of the period as well as the political, philosophical, and social commentaries of the era. After a broad overview, including developments in French and Parisian history in the 1920s and ?30s, students will select (with the guidance of the instructor) an area to research and write a 10 to 12 page essay based on the array of primary sources collected by the instructor. Reading knowledge of French is not required. The course will especially highlight the contribution of women. In addition to 395 credit for History majors, the course is open for 350 registration for students in Gender and Sexuality Studies. Students from all disciplines are welcome.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Work & Occupations: Focus on GenderThe gender division of labor is a key organizing principle in all known societies, but it takes a fascinating array of forms. In industrialized and post-industrial societies, women have increasingly taken up paid employment and moved into formerly-masculine fields, driven by demand for women workers as the economy shifts toward the service sector, and more recently by feminist movements. Yet women are still doing the majority of caring and household labor, while men's take-up of traditionally feminine caring labor has been far more limited. Moreover, the sex segregation of occupations and substantial gendered earnings gaps remain. Meanwhile, much of the work formerly done by housewives has been outsourced to paid service workers, many of whom migrate from global South to global North to take up this work. Scholars debate about whether and how these arrangements will change, and whether they may be influenced by political initiatives, either top-down (e.g., affirmative action to recruit women to STEM fields) or bottom-up (e.g., cultural and media campaigns to validate new norms). In this course, we will investigate the ways in which work - paid and unpaid, in families and in places of employment - is organized by gender and other forms of power, difference and inequality, such as race, class and migration/citizenship status. We will examine family divisions of labor across diverse households: how do men and women divide domestic work and care for children or others needing care? Where does non-familial provision come into play? What are the consequences for outcomes in paid employment and in terms of the distribution of time, respect, and power? We will learn about the development of the modern economy and occupational sex segregation, as well as how different kinds of men and women are treated at work. Finally, we will consider the role of government policy in sustaining or changing these arrangements.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Health ActivismIssues of health and disease have been inextricably entangled with politics this last year. Scientific recommendations, public health mandates, and the role of institutions from the CDC and the FDA to the WHO have been subject to heated debate and partisan politics. Meanwhile, the pandemic has made newly visible and further exacerbated ongoing health disparities within the U.S. and globally. Simultaneously, demands for healing justice (Black Lives Matter), the freedom to thrive (BYP 100) and the right to live (Poor People's Campaign) articulate a politics that reconceptualize health and healing as urgent liberation projects, building on a tradition of radical health activism in the U.S. since the 1960s. To make sense of this moment, we examine this tradition of radical health activism, which often targeted these same institutions in their efforts to transform healthcare in the U.S., to eliminate ongoing health disparities, and to challenge the contemporaneous ideological assumptions about gender, sexuality, race, and class that inform (and are often used to justify) these disparities. We begin with AIDS activist Sarah Shulman's recent political history of ACT UP, Let the Record Show: A Political History of ACT UP New York, 1987-1993 (2021), which also functions as a primer for how to build a health activist social movement able to respond to pandemic conditions, and pair this with Shulman's ACT UP Oral History Project and online collections of archival materials from ACT UP actions. Importantly, both Shulman and the AIDS activists she interviews attribute the success of ACT UP to members' use of tactics and strategies they learned as participants in earlier forms of health activism--in establishing community health centers and free clinics during the Civil Rights Movement, in Black Panther Party survival programs, in setting up underground abortion services pre-Roe v Wade and in the broader feminist health and reproductive rights movements, and in defense campaigns to secure the rights of those incarcerated in prisons and mental health institutions. In our second unit, we explore each of these earlier movements, beginning with participants' accounts collected in the ACT UP Oral History Project, and then through recent histories of each movement and related online archival collections and collections of activist ephemera from each housed in Northwestern's Special Collections. In our third unit, we make use of this history of radical health activism to explore the politics of the present and to examine current movements that build on and carry forward these legacies.",

Using Gender, Queer, Trans, Asian American, and Digital Humanities Theories, we will discuss the cross-cultural intersections, dialogues, refusals, and adaptions when thinking about medical travel to Thailand for gender/sex related surgeries. We will examine Thai cultural/historical conceptions of sex and gender, debates concerning bodies and diagnoses, and changes in presentations of sex/gender related surgeries offered online. We will also explore how digital archives are created and managed. Investigating transcripts of live interviews, medical discourses, and an archive of web images offering GAS surgeries produced by Thais for non-Thais will serve as axes for investigating this topic.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Health ActivismHow do conceptions of health relate to ideological assumptions about gender, sexuality, and race? In this course we will explore these questions through a close examination of historic and current activist movements that have attempted to challenge contemporaneous conceptions of health and models of disease. Case studies will include the 1970s-era Women's Health Movement(s), including an examination of its relationship to the 19th century Birth Control Movement and its transformation with the emergence of a Reproductive Justice Movement in the 1990s; AIDS activism from beginning of the AIDS crisis and the formation of ACT UP to present activist campaigns that contest both the inequitable distribution of medical knowledge and resources and the (bio)medicalization of sexual health; the several strands of breast cancer activism that emerged in the 1990s and the increasing overlap between breast cancer activism and current environmental activism; mental health activism and its evolution in response to the rise of psychopharmacology; and current trans activism which critiques both the diagnostic categories and medical protocols that institutionalize the gender binary and the production of what Dean Spade refers to as an inequitable distribution of life chances. In each case, we will consider how activists frame the problem, the tactics they use to mobilize a diverse group of social actors around the problem, and their success in creating a social movement that challenges contemporary medical models and the ideological assumptions that inform them. The course also introduces students to recent interdisciplinary scholarship on social movements.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Paris Noir in the 20th CenturyIn 1924, when the African-American poet Langston Hughes arrived in Paris, hungry with only seven dollars in his pocket, he ran up the Champs Elys?es in the snow, thrilled to see the Arc de Triomphe in the distance. In Montmartre where he eventually found a job as a busboy and occasional bouncer, he consoled Ada Bricktop Smith, the singer and dancer from New York who owned of the most popular jazz club in the neighborhood and for whose attention Cole Porter and F. Scott Fitzgerald competed. Soon, Josephine Baker (originally from St. Louis, Missouri) would shock and delight audiences with her Revue N?gre to become the most celebrated entertainer in Paris. While state-side, newspapers dubbed this community, the Harlem Renaissance Overseas, Black and Brown artists, intellectuals, students, journalists and other sojourners from the United States encountered another exotic in Paris: their own counter-parts from the Caribbean and Africa. Out of this engagement, a multi-lingual diasporic identity developed within a new internationalism. It birthed the N?gritude movement and fostered an anti-colonial nationalist opposition that would lead de-colonization struggles in the 1950s and ?60s. This seminar invites students to explore this extraordinary flowering of artistic and political expression. Over the quarter, we will study the Afro-diasporic poetry, novels, painting, photography, film, music, and dance of the period as well as the political, philosophical, and social commentaries of the era. After a broad overview, including developments in French and Parisian history in the 1920s and ?30s, students will select (with the guidance of the instructor) an area to research and write a 10 to 12 page essay based on the array of primary sources collected by the instructor. Reading knowledge of French is not required. The course will especially highlight the contribution of women. In addition to 395 credit for History majors, the course is open for 350 registration for students in Gender and Sexuality Studies. Students from all disciplines are welcome.",

The course provides a transition to advanced studies in these areas.

These theoretical texts are placed in dialogue analyzing several contemporary fiction and film. Seminar discussions require synchronous participation. They query how queer theory formulates racial, class and national identities in relation to sexuality, and how it might offer politics beyond those based on identity.

Our challenge is to gain understanding of feminist theory (and practice) not as series of progressive waves (much less an undifferentiated monolithic entity) but as a multifaceted academic field of continuous debate animated by contemporary problems of gender, race, sexuality, class, power, oppression, exclusion, exploitation, action, violence, sovereignty, and relations of rule within and beyond what Gayle Rubin famously called the sex/gender system. The seminar will politicize these problems and stage encounters through the reading and interpretation of selected authors and texts, provisionally organized according to the following approaches and genres: (1) feminist historical materialist critiques of capitalism, global capital, sexual and racial division of labor, relations of (re)production; (2) standpoint feminisms (Black, white, of color) multiple voices, subjugated knowledges, experience and consciousness, coalition building; (3) theorizing intersectionality; Black feminist critique of interlocking oppressions; racialized and gendered structures of power, politics of identity; (4) dominance (radical) feminism, male violence against women, female sexuality as gender oppression, masculine domination as a social system; (5) postmodern critiques of gendered subjectivity; feminism and queer theory, heteronormativity, politics of performativity, beyond-the-binary; (6) feminist new materialisms, bodies that matter, biopower, posthuman ontologies of becoming; (7) feminist postcolonial criticism, alterity of the subaltern, decoloniality of gender, decentering Europe and the (feminist) West; (8) feminist political theory, sexual violence and gendered sovereignty of the postcolonial state, the sexed citizen and the heteropatriarchal nation; (9) feminist politics, world-building, solidarity, resistance, subversion, forms of freedom.

This course will introduce students to the Greek New Testament, particularly the gospels, as we investigate how this unique genre functions. We will focus on the book of Mark, but our goal will be to develop enough proficiency that students will be capable of reading the other gospels at their will. While reading significant portions of Mark we will also begin a thorough review of elementary Greek grammar.Some brief readings from the Greek classical period will be included as well, both to highlight the uniqueness of the prose styles employed in each period, and to prepare students for the transition into Greek 201-2.",

    "ClassOverview": "Women play such an important role in the Odyssey that 19th century scholar Samuel Butler thought its author was a woman. Odysseus' survival during his return journey from Troy to Ithaca involves encounters with a series of powerful females?some beautiful, others monstrous?who may secure or jeopardize his homecoming, while his reinstalment as the legitimate ruler of Ithaca after a long absence depends on the willingness and ability of his wife Penelope to keep male competitors at bay. The course explores constructions of gender ideology in select passages across the Odyssey, with a special focus on negotiations of power and authority and the extent to which the poem has contributed to the construction and naturalization of patriarchal ideology. Special attention will be paid to the formularity of Homeric epic and the way digital tools such as the Chicago Homer can help us detect, analyze, and interpret formulas.",

As we shall see, debates over eschatology (the branch of theology concerned with death and other last things) intersect with profound philosophical questions: What is the purpose of human life? What is a person? (An individual or a member of a collective? A body or a soul?) How (if at all) do humans differ from non-human animals? Can spiritual and scientific conceptions of the universe be reconciled? In order to consider these questions, we will explore the ways in which concepts of the afterlife, the apocalypse, the resurrection and final judgment, etc., have shaped religious traditions, works of art and literature, social and political developments, and scientific theories.",

Because we have never thought that laughter has its own history. This seminar takes literary texts as a springboard and teaches laughter in its historical forms and variations through slow reading and text analysis. Students will look into what humanity laughs at seeking to revisit who modern human beings are. The course will introduce the students to some key most influential theories of laughter (including Chateaubriand, Bergson, Bakhtin, Screech), and will help students apply these theories to literary texts ranging from the 16th century Praise of Folly by Erasmus through the late 20st century Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie. The purpose of the course is to explore various forms of laughter through the literary texts created by Dutch, German, French, Russian, Jewish, Czech, British, Colombian, Mexican, US, and Iranian writers.

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Nationalism in China and TibetTibet is an ethnic autonomous region of the People's Republic of China. This status recognizes the distinctive cultural and political heritage of Tibet but nonetheless affirms Tibet as an integral part of China. Tibet was Peacefully Liberated by the People's Liberation Army in 1950-1951. Previously, the Republican and Qing imperial states variously claimed sovereignty or suzerainty over Tibet. Many Tibetans, whether living in Tibet or abroad, contest the historical and moral legitimacy of this rule, or question the particular arrangements that govern the place of Tibet, Tibetan people, and Tibetan language and culture as part of China's mosaic of fifty-six ethnic groups. The Dalai Lama (a Buddhist spiritual leader), and foreign supporters as diverse as Bjork and Paris Hilton, have made Free Tibet a familiar slogan and social cause. Within China such sentiments are commonly viewed as a serious attack on national integrity. This course examines competing claims regarding the national status of Tibet in light of the historically complex cultural and political relationships between Tibet and China. We will focus on the specifics of 20th c. Chinese and Tibetan nationalisms and probe the nature of nations and nationalism generally. As a famous essay we will study asks, What is a nation? We will also consider the relevance of history-based nationalist arguments concerning religious freedom, cultural autonomy, modern progress, and the nature of complex, multi-cultural nations, such as China (or, for that matter, the USA).",

Touted as the land of the free and the home of the brave, it is portrayed a city on a hill upon which God shed His grace.

Placing past into conversation with present, we will examine, discuss, and debate how these ideas have contributed to diverging and changing ideas about United States history, especially in our current post-truth moment.

In 2016, historians began using #vastearlyamerica to describe a new, more inclusive approach to North American history from the fifteenth to the mid-nineteenth century. Projects labelled as #vastearlyamerica included larger geographic and temporal frameworks, focused on diverse groups of people, and even used new methods and technology, like social media, to engage a larger audience. In addition to focusing on the histories of Indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, laborers, and women, this course will also use public projects on #vastearlyamerica as readings, like the 1619 Project podcast, Claudio Saunt's interactive website Mapping the People of Early America, and museum exhibitions that expand the public's understanding of early America. Students will not only consider the advantages and disadvantages of the #vastearlyamerica framework - they will also discuss why early American history matters in the present day.About Re/Intro Seminars -- 200-0-xx (each limited to eight students)After more than a year and a half of Zooming, we're all a little rusty when it comes to in-person learning.

It was the greatest single demographic calamity in recorded history: between 1346 and 1353, the population in affected areas was depleted by as much as 60%. The plague was a true pandemic which reverberated throughout the world.

The manner in which different diseases spread reflect important aspects of world history. For instance, the spread of the Black Death was dependent on the revival of long-distance trade; smallpox was spread throughout the new world by both territorial conquest and the human trafficking in slaves; cholera, which was transmitted infected water, was (and is) representative of poor hygiene and abject poverty -- factors that were often class related. Other diseases, like tuberculosis, were (and are) often indicative of poor working conditions.

It was the greatest single demographic calamity in recorded history: between 1346 and 1353, the population in affected areas was depleted by as much as 60%. The plague was a true pandemic which reverberated throughout the world. This course will use the bubonic plague as a jumping off point for the study of other pandemics, analyzing the social and environmental factors that account for the spread of a given disease; efforts to understand and vanquish it; and the ultimate impact on society. The manner in which different diseases spread reflect important aspects of world history. For instance, the spread of the Black Death was dependent on the revival of long-distance trade; smallpox was spread throughout the new world by both territorial conquest and the human trafficking in slaves; cholera, which was transmitted infected water, was (and is) representative of poor hygiene and abject poverty -- factors that were often class related. Other diseases, like tuberculosis, were (and are) often indicative of poor working conditions. As the recent outbreak of cholera in Haiti attests, many of these diseases have never been eradicated, even as new ones continue to wreak havoc. The course will conclude with an examination of COVID-19 with a view to understanding what has changed and what has remained the same in society's response to the world of pandemics.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Zionism and It's CriticsZionism ? or Jewish nationalism ? is a little studied, yet much maligned ideology. For some, it is the truest expression of Jewish sovereignty. For others, Zionism has been derided as colonialism and racism. Yet, what is Zionism? (Or more accurately, is there such thing as one monolithic Zionism?) And who and what have been its historical proponents and opponents? The first half of the course focuses on the pre-1948 period, considering classical Zionist thought (selected from different streams of Zionist ideology) such as political Zionism (Herzl), cultural Zionism (Ahad Ha-am), revisionist Zionism (Jabotinsky), and binationalism (Buber), as well as dissent both within and outside the pre-state community in Palestine, including the incipient Palestinian national movement. Particular attention will be paid to themes such as the Rejection of the Diaspora and the Creation of the New Jew, the Arab Question, and the religious/secular divide. The second half of the course will examine the evolution of Zionist thought in the post 1948 period, revisiting some old debates as well as new developments on left and right like the Caananite movement, the Israeli settler movement, the Israeli Black Panther party, and critiques from women, post-Zionists, and the Jewish-American diaspora. The course will also highlight the growth of external opponents to Zionism amongst the Palestinians (secular and religious), the Arab world, and the international community. The course will conclude with discussion of two contemporary debates on Zionism is Racism, and the relationship between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.",

    "ClassOverview": "The growth of the Latino population has transformed the United States and has led to heightened debates about their political power, cultural influence, citizenship, civil rights, and ethnic and racial categorization. Yet as the 2020 election demonstrated, many Americans still don't really understand who Latinos are?or who Latinos have been, and will become.While the increased attention to Latinos may feel new, Latino communities have played a pivotal role in U.S. history for centuries. In this course, we will explore the 500-year history of Latinos in the United States?and, indeed, across the Americas?from the 16th century through the early 21st century.In its broadest sense, Latino History offers a reinterpretation of United States history that focuses on race, migration, labor, and empire. It is also the history of a community?or several communities, including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominican Americans, Central Americans, and Cuban Americans, and others?that represents a growing percentage of the U.S. population as a whole, and one that will increasingly influence the politics, social life, culture, and economy of the United States.Although we will focus on the United States, we also will examine the movement of Latino peoples within and between the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean. We will use a variety of media, including literature, film, and music, as well as more traditional historical interpretations. Ultimately, you will gain a deeper understanding of the issues and histories that bring Latinos together, those that continue to divide them, their multiple and shifting racial classification, and the long struggles for equality and belonging that have animated their histories.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course covers social, political, and cultural developments during the Tokugawa period, from 1600-1868. During over two hundred fifty years of peace, samurai became administrators (while writing incessantly about death and honor), merchants created a culture of conspicuous consumption, wealthy peasants took advantage of an expanding market economy, and people from all status groups found common ground in their enjoyment of art, literature, and drama. By analyzing readings that include the rantings of an unemployed (and slightly unhinged) samurai and a series of archival documents, students will gain an understanding of this pivotal era in Japanese history.",

How have the records of the Inquisition been used to reconstruct the histories of Jews, African healers, bigamists, homosexuals, and witches, among others? Participants will pursue their own answers and even construct an alternate archive by which to tell the stories of persecuted figures. Topics include religious tolerance and intolerance; healing and love magic in the Americas; the policing and politics of gender and sexuality; and the lives of Jewish conversos.",

The study of the Cuban revolutions will be helpful to understand broader phenomena: how societies change, how they process ideas about nationalism and democracy, and how the fruits of revolutions acquire a particular meaning regarding defining and shaping the future of societies.This course includes reading exercises from historical sources to construct key questions toward the sources and reflect on their role in research.",

    "ClassOverview": "In 1945, Germany was in ruins. The defeat of the Nazis had physically destroyed Germany's infrastructure, morally delegitimized its institutions, and divided its diminished territory into a capitalist West and a socialist East. The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) represented two experiments of how to create the ideal society, and the German-German border, vividly symbolized by the BerlinWall, quickly became a central site of the Cold War.This course examines those two states and the solutions they developed to common challenges, including re-civilizing committed Nazis, confronting the memory of the Holocaust, reconstructing a shattered economy, combatting terrorism, managing migration, and addressing environmental degradation.How did these two societies re-civilize in the wake of global war and genocide? How is it that this ruined land of 1945 could become, within fifty years, the richest and most stable nation in Europe?",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Holocaust Restorative JusticeThe most well-known and best documented case of genocide of the 20th century, the Holocaust, attracted the attention of both the general public and academics, who were especially interested in understanding what happened during WWII and the reasons for human participation in such a horrendous event. The mass murder unleashed by the Nazis was also preceded, accompanied, or followed by a massive theft of Jewish property called Aryanization, which was redistributed to numerous individual and institutional Aryan (gentile) beneficiaries. The postwar consequences of the Holocaust massive dispossession of human victims were somehow neglected by scholars, except the criminal justice efforts illustrated by the trials of Nazi perpetrators. Less was known about the other side of the postwar justice - restorative justice - namely the efforts to repair, to the extent possible, the terrible harm inflicted on the Jews and other groups of victims and their livelihoods by the Nazi genocidal regime and its collaborators. The topic of restitution and reparations started to gain more attention especially in the 1990s when the media coverages of the fate of Jewish property looted by the Nazis and their collaborators triggered the interest of scholars and the general public especially in the US, Western Europe, and Israel. This growing interest in Holocaust restitution and reparations was rooted in the opening of new archives (enabled by the collapse of the Iron Curtain), the litigation pursued by Holocaust survivors and their heirs, the spread of a globalized economy, and a growing concern for human rights and the repairing historical injustices.This course will explore the restorative justice processes that took place in the aftermath of the Holocaust, focusing particularly on the restitution of property (such as houses, businesses, art) and reparations efforts in Europe, Israel, and the US, locations which hosted the largest Jewish communities after the Holocaust. During this course we will discuss some of the main restitution and reparations events, including those related to the postwar governments' and Allies forces' efforts to return the Aryanized houses, businesses, jobs, valuables, and art objects to their former Jewish owners, the negotiations of the 1952 Reparations Agreement between West Germany and the Claims Conference, the 1990s Swiss Banks debate, and the survivors' litigation campaign in the US courts during the 1990s and 2000s.Our examination of the Holocaust restorative justice processes will be based primarily on historical texts of Holocaust scholars as well as on postwar documents and autobiographical accounts of Jewish survivors. In addition to such texts, we will watch excerpts from documentary films, which depict the survivors' efforts to obtain legitimate restitution and reparations.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: History of Predicting the FutureThe past and present are shaped in large part by our beliefs about what the future holds. In this seminar, we will investigate human attempts to anticipate events yet to come, from antiquity until the present (but with an emphasis on the period since 1800). How have people in different times and places gone about anticipating the future? What phenomena have gripped their attention: weather, economy, human society, or individual fates? Have their imaginations been utopian, dystopian, or even apocalyptic, and what does that tell us about the historical moment in which they lived? And crucially, what happened when predictions failed?as so often happened? Using a global range of primary and secondary sources, from revealed prophecies and science fiction to genetic codes and financial speculations, we will examine why and how our historical subjects believed the future might be foreseeable. This course fits today's concerns about the future of the environment (notably climate change) and humanity into a long history of decision-making in the face of uncertainty.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Paris Noir in the Twentieth CenturyIn 1924, when the African-American poet Langston Hughes arrived in Paris, hungry with only seven dollars in his pocket, he ran up the Champs Elys?es in the snow, thrilled to see the Arc de Triomphe in the distance.  In Montmartre where he eventually found a job as a busboy and occasional bouncer, he consoled Ada Bricktop Smith, the singer and dancer from New York who owned of the most popular jazz club in the neighborhood and for whose attention Cole Porter and F. Scott Fitzgerald competed.  Soon, Josephine Baker (originally from St. Louis, Missouri) would shock and delight audiences with her Revue N?gre to become the most celebrated entertainer in Paris.  While state-side, newspapers dubbed this community, the Harlem Renaissance Overseas,  Black and Brown artists, intellectuals, students, journalists and other sojourners from the United States encountered another exotic in Paris: their own counter-parts from the Caribbean and Africa.  Out of this engagement, a multi-lingual diasporic identity developed within a new internationalism.  It birthed the N?gritude movement and fostered an anti-colonial nationalist opposition that would lead de-colonization struggles in the 1950s and ?60s.  This seminar invites students to explore this extraordinary flowering of artistic and political expression.  Over the quarter, we will study the Afro-diasporic poetry, novels, painting, photography, film, music, and dance of the period as well as the political, philosophical, and social commentaries of the era.  After a broad overview, including developments in French and Parisian history in the 1920s and ?30s, students will select (with the guidance of the instructor) an area to research and write a 10 to 12 page essay based on the array of primary sources collected by the instructor.  Reading knowledge of French is not required.  The course will especially highlight the contribution of women.  In addition to 395 credit for History majors, the course is open for 350 registration for students in Gender and Sexuality Studies.  Students from all disciplines are welcome.",

They have also become an important expression of social anxieties and desires, and an important way to understand the relationship between the individual and the modern state. In this course, we will approach conspiracy narratives and the theories they embody both as symptoms and as modes of knowledge. This module will provide students with the necessary historical and psychological knowledge to understand why these theories formed throughout history and how they have become widespread. The main purpose of this new module is to allow students to engage with the society they live as informed and critical thinker individuals. Students will be required to work in small groups and produce a believable conspiracy theory which has to be based on psychological and historical research.",

This course introduces you to the history and politics of constituting archives for writing histories of colonial and excolonial places. With a tight focus on one region in West Africa?Yor?b?land?with current and old links to the Black Atlantic and the Americas, we will learn about the mutual interplay between methodology, theory, and theme. We will engage that interplay through a practicum on historical linguistics, a non-traditional method for writing history without documents.

It has been examined from multiple perspectives: as a sexualized transmitter of original sin; as ultimate guarantor of survival in the afterlife; as alternately intrinsic to and separate from gender roles; as sexually indeterminate; as an object of dissection; as entity to be manipulated by eugenics; as spectacle; as conveyor of psychological trauma; and many more. Scholars have also become increasingly aware of the more abstract uses of the body, such imagistic uses for uniting society into a corporate whole.

Each week, moving in roughly chronological order, we will discuss major scholarly debates on topics ranging from colonial encounters, slavery, sex, and religion, to revolutionary and founding politics.  We will quickly find that if the field of early American history is a stage, its cast, setting, and plot have changed profoundly over the past several decades (as Alan Taylor observes in American Colonies).  Its starring actors used to be Englishmen on the eastern coast of North America.  Now, historians engage a more sprawling cast of characters: men and women from hundreds of ethnic, religious, and linguistic backgrounds, who collectively inhabit an entire continent--not to mention islands and oceans.  Drawing from classic accounts as well as from more recent scholarship, we will consider the benefits and the drawbacks of these more recent approaches, and we will also debate future possibilities for the field.  Through close readings of texts, critical discussions, book reviews, and exploration of individual interests, we will hone our abilities to identify, assess, and develop historical arguments, methodologies, and interpretative frameworks.",

In so doing, it seeks to connect literatures that have too often been kept separate: Native American and Indigenous histories, settler colonialism, and overseas empire. Our focus will be on what imperialism has meant for land and lives, primarily examining the mechanics of U.S. empire, and at times considering its broader and more diffuse aspects. In treating overseas empire, we will devote more attention to colonies and administered land than to the United States' economic dominance and global cultural power.",

From World War I through the end of the Vietnam War, African Americans kept coming out of the American South, to the North and West, mostly to cities like Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Tulsa, Cleveland, Detroit, Wichita, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Like many other migrants and immigrants, they were often obstructed, misrepresented, and rebuked on the beginnings and ends (not to mention in the middles) of their trips. Yet they kept coming, and their movement, as well as its aftermath, culturally redefined the United States, along with the migrants themselves.This seminar will be an intensive, interdisciplinary study of literature, music, film, and visual art produced during and about the first and second waves of the Great Migration, from roughly 1917 until 1970.  We will explore the Chicago Renaissance as a cultural flowering of the Migration's first wave, and consider the philosophical and cultural critiques offered by the African American intelligentsia of the period. In addition, we will examine the migration of Black Folklife?faith practices, music, foodways, and vernacular iterations?and chart its impacts across and beyond the US. Finally, the class will explore what some sociologists and urban studies scholars have called a reverse migration, citing a statistical exodus of African Americans out of the Great Migration's destination cities in numbers that now rival or exceed the movement itself.We will also focus on themes of home, community, and physical place and space, ideas that we imagine will be especially resonant for first-year students. They may be meaningful in different ways depending on how the school year unfolds in 2021-22, but we expect that students will be able to find important points of engagement about these concepts, whether in person or remote.Sample course texts may include:Clarke Hine, Darlene.

Do the poems describe a largely imaginary realm created by their author, or do they reflect a particular period of ancient Greek history?and if so, which one? How did the circulation of the poems help contribute to a collective sense of Greek identity over a wide area of the eastern Mediterranean?This course explores the society, economy, and culture of Iron Age Greece with special attention to the Geometric and early Archaic periods, emphasizing what scholars have learned through archaeological discoveries along with study of the poems themselves. Topics include the excavations at Troy and other sites; contacts with Egypt and the Near East and colonization in the Mediterranean world; trade, exchange, and the technology of travel; literacy and oral tradition; political communities and warfare; gender and family relationships; religion, burial practices, and the art of ritual and commemoration. We will also examine some of the ways scholars and artists today are re-exploring the poems and their enduring themes.",

Focused on a single region in the United States?Lower Louisiana, East Texas, and the giant body of water that connects them?our course asks what this distinctive landscape of land and water can tell us about our place on this planet, at this moment in history. The Gulf of Mexico is emblematic of stories we tell ourselves about racial and cultural difference, climate crisis and climate vulnerability, survival and the end of the world. Through the cause of climate justice, students in the course will examine how today's political thinking pits economic and ecological priorities against each other, and against human survival. Three events of the early 21st century?the flooding of New Orleans in and after Hurricane Katrina (2005); BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010); and the flooding of the Houston, Texas area after Hurricane Harvey (2017)?show vividly how the vulnerability of contemporary life around the Gulf of Mexico is shaped by longer histories, and imagined futures, in which natural disaster and human agency can be hard to tell apart. The inextricability of racial, economic, and environmental impacts that follow such events, with their potent mix of accident and decision, neglect and care, violence and resistance, is not unique to this region: it is part of the unfolding story of the modern world. Students will work in between history, ecology, and literature in order to ground themselves in the environmental humanities, an emerging area of study that helps us see how material histories and natural ecologies intersect with literature and art.Readings may include selections from these books:Jack Davis, The Gulf: The Making of an American SeaAndy Horowitz, Katrina: A History, 1915-2015Eugenie L.

Healthcare workers, and physicians and nurses in particular, have long held sway in the popular imagination as heroes, villains, and even complicated anti-heroes. What can we learn about the societal values we place on medicine (and medical personnel) by exploring the ways that medical heroes and villains are depicted to wide public audiences (or the ways they write about themselves)? What do these fictional and non-fictional accounts have to tell us about societal celebrations, anxieties and ambiguities relating to medicine? How might we contemplate the ways societal norms relating to race, gender, sexuality, place of origin, ability, and other identifiers become mapped onto the stories the public consumes relating to medicine? What can these stories tell us about anxieties regarding life and death, technology, science, and culture? Who is portrayed as hero, who as villain, who as victim, and who as backdrop to the narrative? What perspectives are often silenced or left in the backdrop in these popularly-consumed narratives about medicine? In this course, we will read and view fictional, dramatized, and non-fiction narratives aimed at wide public audiences. In so doing, we will use medicine as a lens on a wide array of societal ambiguities, potentialities, inequalities and silences.NOTE: Students will be exposed to some stories and cases they may find disturbing.",

This course will highlight religious movements, inter-tribal organizations, key intellectual figures, student movements, armed standoffs, non-violent protest, and a variety of visions for Indigenous community self-determination. The course will emphasize environmental justice.",

    "ClassOverview": "Under Representation: Is there a mirror for me?This course proposes to explore both the philosophical idea of representation in modern Aesthetics as well as the visual culture practices that have contested its racial and gendered regime?resisting being reabsorbed on the condition that difference be reduced to minor inflections of equivalence. If Aesthetics has historically been the realm of thought where universalizing claims of political and self-determining subjecthood demarcated the threshold of the human subject in and of their representation: how have unfreedom, subjection, and social injustice been defined in relation to representation? Taking the Block Museum exhibition Who Says, Who Shows, What Counts: Thinking About History with The Block's Collection as a survey of the compelling stories that can be told through works of art, we examine not only who and what gets represented and/or erased but also what constitutes visibility in visual culture, historically and down to the present. We interrogate the racial and gender power dynamics that have regulated access to recognition by fundamentally de-naturalizing the ways in which these regimes have taught us to see. Closely exploring particular works of art and literature, we ask what the experience of seeing yourself represented in or by art involves and means, how it dramatizes the lived experience of being included or barred from social recognition, institutional legitimacy, political agency.",

    "ClassOverview": "National Cinema/World CinemaWhat makes a film French or Korean or Mexican? Is it where the film is made or where it takes place? The languages spoken or the actors who play the roles? Do national cinemas have distinct visual styles?and if so, how does that sit with the idea that cinema is somehow a universal language?We will explore debates about the national and/or global dimensions of cinema, from some of the classic texts of early film theory to such recent films as Parasite. Following readings on the concepts of cinema and the nation, we will study the global circulation of ideas about the films of the great director Yasujiro Ozu, routinely said to be the most Japanese of all filmmakers, but also an influence on directors throughout the world. We will also explore the idea of new wave cinemas: Originally used to describe innovative French films of the late 50s and 60s, new wave became both a critical and a marketing concept to group films from Japan, Poland, Iran, and many other countries around the world, to the present day.We will watch, read about, and discuss a wide range of films from around the world, with an emphasis on Western Europe and East Asia. Beyond Ozu, directors may include Sergei Eisenstein, Claire Denis, Wim Wenders, Edward Yang, Abbas Kiraostami, Abderrahmane Sissako, Bong Joon-ho, and Lee Isaac Chung.",

Furthermore, we will look at tendencies in contemporary theater and dance, (Wilson, Wooster Group, Forsythe, Bausch) and discuss aesthetic concepts that influence contemporary opera composition. An important part of the class will be a creative workshop: the students will work on drafting an opera project.",

    "ClassOverview": "Independent-minded writers have always had an uneasy relationship with the Russian regime, but before the Revolution, writers like Tolstoy and Pushkin were seen by the Russian people as the conscience of society. In their works, many questioned the prevailing regime, which expected intellectuals to support the State. While the Tsars sought to place limits on Tolstoy, Pushkin, and others, their privileged place in society prevented the regime from massively repressing them and their works.This all changed when Stalin came to the Kremlin. His regime expected the writer not just to enlighten the masses, but to mobilize them to accomplish the goals of the State. Using an extensive system of repression and rewards, the Stalinist regime either coopted writers and intellectuals, or silenced them altogether. Even after the death of Stalin, the regime forced writers either to put their talents at the service of the State, or to go underground.Nevertheless, starting during the Thaw in the sixties, the USSR saw the resurrection of the idea of the independent-minded writer as the conscience of society - but not without consequences to the writers themselves. They circulated hand-typed manuscripts (samizdat) or smuggled them for publication abroad (tamizdat). Repressive measures against dissident writers continued until the late eighties, when Gorbachev began to allow more free debate (glasnost).Finally, under Putin, repression returns, but it is focused on those who dare to use mass media to oppose the regime's controlling national narrative. The Russian regime, while avoiding in most cases outright censorship, again institutes measures to reward those who support the State, and intimidate and even silence those who don't.We will examine this relationship of the Russian writer to the State, and discuss how successive rulers have alternated between thaw and freeze, seeking to find what they saw as the proper balance in their efforts to control the national narrative and thus ensure the survival of the regime.",

    "ClassOverview": "What is Black internationalism? Why has it emerged as a scholarly term and field over the past two decades and become especially dominant in the past five to ten years? What is its relationship to global colonialism, New World slavery, Pan-Africanism, diaspora, and the political and cultural more broadly? This course will aim to provide answers to these questions initially guided by Cedric J. Robinson's idea of the Black Radical Tradition (1983) and Paul Gilroy's idea of the Black Atlantic (1993). How do these texts, if at all, inform the scholarly usage of Black internationalism that comes afterward, namely and perhaps initially in Brent Hayes Edwards' The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism (2003)? How should we account for the persistence of Marxism and the Haitian Revolution within the field of Black internationalism? What about the field's turn toward Black women's historical theorizations of gender and sexuality, and most recently the Black nationalism of Garveyism? Moreover, what does it mean to view these political and cultural histories through a Black internationalist lens? All of these aforementioned questions will form one of two bases to the course; the second is research practices. Given Black internationalism is indebted to scholars in multiple fields?Black Studies, History, Political Theory, Cultural Studies, English Literature, and more?students will become versed in several disciplinary research and writing practices as a means of aiding their own independent research. Considering my own background in History and Black Studies, we will pay particular attention to the relationship between history and Black critical theory. How do scholars produce research that crosses both of these strands? What is the archive broadly conceived? How does archival work relate to the production of theory and vice versa? Moreover, how do we pursue an empirical and/or theoretical project that is (Black) internationalist in design and execution?",

    "ClassOverview": "Course Description:  In 2005, leaders from around the globe met to discuss how, for the first time in human history, over half of the world's population lives in cities (Crane and Kinzig 2005). In this class, we will examine how residents of cities throughout human history have used things to negotiate and shape urban life. By assessing the stuff that makes up cities, we will explore the concept of materiality, which refers to the physical objects or things that comprise human existence. We will ask: What is the material stuff that makes up urban environments? How do these materials shape the lived experiences of urban residents? And how do these objects, buildings, and spaces materially express social relationships and inequalities in cities? Once we have learned how to examine urbanism through material things, we will explore how these materials intersect with other areas of social life in cities and consider: How are social phenomena, such as religion, gender, and sexuality, materially shaped and shaped by the experiences of urban residents? How have marginalized residents used things to rework and navigate the challenges of urban life? To answer these questions, course materials will draw on an interdisciplinary collection (e.g. Anthropology, Archaeology, Geography, History, and more) of scholarship anchored around the interrogation of the materials that comprise urban life in the present but also in the distant past. Drawing on studies of urbanism throughout history and around the globe, students will learn how to see the long-term material relationships between people and urban environments and how they vary cross-culturally. By the end of the term, students will be able to communicate (to peers and the general public) how material things shape urban experience and be able to demonstrate, through their own analyses, how social phenomena are materially expressed in city life.",

The poem is both an adventure story and an exhaustive, assessment of the state of politics, society, religion, literature, philosophy, and theology at the beginning of the fourteenth century. This course examines a selection of cantos Dante's Inferno and Purgatorio in its cultural, social and political context. In particular we will explore how the underground world imagined by the poet relates to late medieval urban life and culture. A guiding concern of the discussion is to assess the ways in which Dante changed our understanding of the relationship between the human and the divine, justice and love, will and reason, happiness and knowledge, literature and the Bible. Political turmoil, philosophical and theological paradigms social and religious conflict all converge in the making of Inferno and Purgatorio and will thus form crucial elements of our investigation.

    "ClassOverview": "Course Title: Tales of Love and Darkness: Eros and Isolation in Modern Hebrew LiteratureFew literatures can have been more isolated and isolating than Modern Hebrew Literature in its formative years in Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Young Jewish men are afforded a glimpse of the intellectual vistas lying beyond the stifling confines of the traditional Jewish shtetl.  Reviled in these traditional communities as heretics they sought refuge from ostracism, persecution, in the tenements and boarding-houses of the metropolises of Europe. Umbilically attached to an unspoken language these outsiders wrote in full awareness that their potential audience consisted largely of each other. This imagined community was an exclusively male domain; the handful of female Hebrew writers in the Europe constituted an absolute anomaly.It was in the erotic realm that this isolation reached its fullest literary summation, especially in the figure of the Talush (the uprooted man) which placed center stage effeminate, masochistic Jewish men often subordinated by ruthless gentile women. This literature breathed of sexual anxiety.The course aims to explore the poetic, the ideological and the gender implications of the interwoven themes of eros and isolation in Hebrew Literature from the turn of the 19th century to the present day.  In doing so, we shall study the migration of these themes along with Hebrew Literature itself from Europe to Palestine and ultimately the State of Israel. Has the rebuilding of the national Home brought the uprooted man his long lost masculinity? And how did the female writer incorporate/become incorporated by the Talush narrative? How do we account for the longevity of this sad and pathetic figure? This course provides an excellent introduction to Modern Hebrew Literature per se: we shall read classic texts by M.Y. Berdichevsky, Y.H. Brenner, S.Y. Agnon, alongside excerpts from contemporary bestselling Israeli novels by Amos Oz, Ya'akov Shabtai and others.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course will examine graphic narratives in the context of global Jewish culture of the last century, focusing on how they have represented the Holocaust as history and memory over time. We will look at the historical and aesthetic development of graphic narrative art in relation to the representation of the Holocaust. To this end, we will scrutinize: (1) Jewish graphic narratives produced during World War II, such as Will Eisner's Spirit. The Tale of the Dictator's Reform (1941) and Horst Rosenthal's Mickey Mouse in the Gurs Internment Camp (1942); (2) 1st generation Jewish American graphic narratives representing the Holocaust, in particular Bernie Krigstein and Al Feldstein's Master Race (1955) and Will Eisner's To the Heart of the Storm (1991); (3) the post-1980s development of (auto)biographic graphic narratives about World War II by the 1.5 generation of Jewish Americans (Miriam Katin' We Are on our Own and Letting It Go), the second generation (Art Spiegelman's Maus and Martin Lemelman's Mendel's Daughter and Two Cents Plain) and the third (plus) generation (Amy Kurzweil's Flying Couch, Leela Corman's The Book of the Dead and The Blood Road, Emil Ferris's My Favorite Thing Is Monsters); (4) contemporary non-Jewish (auto)biographic graphic narratives focusing on perpetrators and Holocaust memory: Nora Krug's Belonging. A German Reckons with History and Home (2018). In our class discussions, we will assess the ways in which Jewish artists have utilized the possibilities of graphic narratives to explore the impact of the Holocaust on Jewish identity and historical experiences and we will also consider the impact of gender and perpetrators' actions on Holocaust representation. We will also examine the dynamics of Holocaust representation in the case of artists that have published multiple graphic narratives concentrating on the Holocaust. We will pay particular attention to how and why different generations of artists use similar or distinct forms of Holocaust construction and what topics they primarily broach.",

    "ClassOverview": "Zionism ? or Jewish nationalism ? is a little studied, yet much maligned ideology. For some, it is the truest expression of Jewish sovereignty. For others, Zionism has been derided as colonialism and racism. Yet, what is Zionism? (Or more accurately, is there such thing as one monolithic Zionism?) And who and what have been its historical proponents and opponents? The first half of the course focuses on the pre-1948 period, considering classical Zionist thought (selected from different streams of Zionist ideology) such as political Zionism (Herzl), cultural Zionism (Ahad Ha-am), revisionist Zionism (Jabotinsky), and binationalism (Buber), as well as dissent both within and outside the pre-state community in Palestine, including the incipient Palestinian national movement. Particular attention will be paid to themes such as the Rejection of the Diaspora and the Creation of the New Jew, the Arab Question, and the religious/secular divide. The second half of the course will examine the evolution of Zionist thought in the post 1948 period, revisiting some old debates as well as new developments on left and right like the Caananite movement, the Israeli settler movement, the Israeli Black Panther party, and critiques from women, post-Zionists, and the Jewish-American diaspora. The course will also highlight the growth of external opponents to Zionism amongst the Palestinians (secular and religious), the Arab world, and the international community. The course will conclude with discussion of two contemporary debates on Zionism is Racism, and the relationship between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.",

We will pay special attention to the emergence of a sin fronteras [beyond borders] politics and how it was operationalized across space and time. Crucial to our study of sin fronteras activism is to understand how, and under what circumstances, Latinxs with U.S. citizen privilege (i.e. Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans) leveraged support for noncitizen immigrants, especially the undocumented. Sin fronteras politics brings Latinxs together, regardless of birthplace, generation, or citizenship status.

    "ClassOverview": "The growth of the Latino population has transformed the United States and has led to heightened debates about their political power, cultural influence, citizenship, civil rights, and ethnic and racial categorization. Yet as the 2020 election demonstrated, many Americans still don't really understand who Latinos are?or who Latinos have been, and will become. While the increased attention to Latinos may feel new, Latino communities have played a pivotal role in U.S. history for centuries. In this course, we will explore the 500-year history of Latinos in the United States?and, indeed, across the Americas?from the 16th century through the early 21st century. In its broadest sense, Latino History offers a reinterpretation of United States history that focuses on race, migration, labor, and empire. It is also the history of a community?or several communities, including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominican Americans, Central Americans, and Cuban Americans, and others?that represents a growing percentage of the U.S. population as a whole, and one that will increasingly influence the politics, social life, culture, and economy of the United States. Although we will focus on the United States, we also will examine the movement of Latino peoples within and between the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean. We will use a variety of media, including literature, film, and music, as well as more traditional historical interpretations. Ultimately, you will gain a deeper understanding of the issues and histories that bring Latinos together, those that continue to divide them, their multiple and shifting racial classification, and the long struggles for equality and belonging that have animated their histories.",

Yet as the 2020 election demonstrated, many Americans still don't really understand who Latinos are?or who Latinos have been, and will become. While the increased attention to Latinos may feel new, Latino communities have played a pivotal role in U.S. history for centuries. In this course, we will explore the 500-year history of Latinos in the United States?and, indeed, across the Americas?from the 16th century through the early 21st century. In its broadest sense, Latino History offers a reinterpretation of United States history that focuses on race, migration, labor, and empire. It is also the history of a community?or several communities, including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominican Americans, Central Americans, and Cuban Americans, and others?that represents a growing percentage of the U.S. population as a whole, and one that will increasingly influence the politics, social life, culture, and economy of the United States. Although we will focus on the United States, we also will examine the movement of Latino peoples within and between the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean. We will use a variety of media, including literature, film, and music, as well as more traditional historical interpretations. Ultimately, you will gain a deeper understanding of the issues and histories that bring Latinos together, those that continue to divide them, their multiple and shifting racial classification, and the long struggles for equality and belonging that have animated their histories.",

The course introduces students to the study and practice of refugee policy - legislative process that produces statutory law, the major theories, techniques, and issues of modern legislation and statutory interpretation by both courts and administrative agencies, the role and authority of administrative agencies, how federal regulations intersect with regulations, guidance and policies at in states and localities. We will consider what local understandings of refugee policy can teach us about the meaning of integration as part of broader discourses on constitutional governance, federalism and civil society. We will also look comparatively at the refugee policy of other countries to consider alternative perspectives, policies and ideologies. Through these explorations, students will gain insight into the complexities of refugee policy and, more specifically, asylum and refugee resettlement as a durable solution for refugees seeking protection.

Real-world communication is not like this at all. This seminar examines communication in our non-ideal world. Our focus will be several forms of deceptive communication: lying, bullshitting, and misleading. We will explore a wide range of topics: what are the linguistic cues to deceptive communication, if any? does lying necessarily involve deception? why is there so much bullshit in contemporary political speech? how is fake news related to lying, misleading, and bullshitting? is fake news a useful notion at all? Our goal will be to figure out what tools and concepts we need to understand the varieties of deception that characterize human language interaction.",

Therefore to understand the process of sentence comprehension, we want to understand (i) what constitute knowledge of language and (ii) how is knowledge of language put to use. In this course we aim to understand these two points and this course serves as an introduction to the field of sentence processing.There are three goals in this course:1. Understand the current state of the field of sentence processing.- This will be studied through readings and lectures.2. Understand what type of experiments and analytical skills have been used in the study of sentence processing.- This will be studied through homework and two exams. You will experience how toanalyze sentences and how to build an experiment to answer specific questions insentence processing through short paper assignment and Laboratory requirement3. Understand what area of sentence processing studies is not well understood well, and in which area we hope to make a significant contribution.",

We will examine how various notions of region - e.g., geographic, environmental, sociocultural, and geopolitical - are both created and challenged through shifting analytic categories. We will also explore the similarities and differences between disciplines in terms of how they constitute and approach the issue of region. In the latter section of the course, we will explore how the region has come under renewed attention in work on transborder, translocal, and transnational circuits, and what distinguishes this new work from earlier kinds of area studies - both theoretically and empirically. Overall, we will inquire what analytic purchase the idea of the region has had, what scholars are responding to by elevating the region analytically, and what spatial practices they showcase as constitutive of region formation.",

What do we know (or think we know) about how memories are encoded in the brain? How is college a different learning environment than high school? Together, we will review scientific studies on the impact of college life on student academic performance, and correlate those findings with studies of human and animal learning in the laboratory. After taking this course, you will have a foundational understanding of the neurobiological basis of memory, learn how to read scientific literature critically, and develop strategies to improve your study habits and performance here at Northwestern University.",

    "ClassOverview": "NEUROSCI 202-0 introduces students to the cellular and molecular processes that allow the nervous system to produce behavior, with a focus on how electrochemical signals are generated, communicated and integrated to transform different sensations into appropriate actions. We all want to know how the mind works in health and what happens when things go wrong in disease. However, first we need to start with the fundamentals, which this course will provide. Learning about neuroscience is like learning a new language, which will require the introduction of new words and the memorization of terminology. Students will be expected to increase their vocabulary so they can begin to appreciate and discuss neuroscience concepts and research in an informed manner. This is not a survey course, rather it is designed to provide a solid foundation for subsequent coursework that delves more deeply into various topics in neuroscience.Prerequisites: Must be a neuroscience major, and either BIOL_SCI 217-0 or BIOL_SC 201-0 and either; CHEM 151-0 or CHEM 171-0 with a B- grade or above; or CHEM 132-0 or CHEM 152-0 or CHEM 172-0.Course content is divided into three sections. The first third focuses on the ionic and molecular basis for generating electric signals in neurons. The second third focuses on electrical and chemical communication between neurons, how these connections are adjusted, and how they develop. The final third will focus on simple circuits that illustrate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that allow us to taste, smell, see, hear, feel and move at the right time. It is recommended that reading be performed prior to lectures to help students discover and remedy misconceptions before the midterm exams. Information in the textbook will provide context and introduction of material in lectures.This is the first NEUROSCI 202-0 offering in academic year 2021-2022. NEUROSCI 202-0 will be offered again in Winter 2022.",

Special emphasis will be placed on the neural basis for the generation of circadian rhythms and on the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle.  The importance of biological rhythms for human health and disease will be covered in this course.

This perhaps helps to explain the persistence of Adam Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand to describe how the market works. Our aim in this course is to make the invisible hand a bit more visible. What does the market do well? What does it do badly? Are there any goods, like sex or human organs, that should not be exchanged on the market? What alternatives are there to the market system?

Thinkers from antiquity to the present have been concerned with the various ways that this ability can be undermined by propaganda, both in purported democracies and in explicitly authoritarian regimes. On the other hand, many radical thinkers have suggested that propaganda isn't always bad, and is perhaps a necessary component of liberatory social and political movements. In this course we will be asking three central questions: What is propaganda? How does propaganda function in the world today? And finally, how can a just society deal with propaganda's negative effects?",

Is democracy always the best political solution (in wartime? general starvation?)? Why should the whole of the people decide and not the specialists in the respective questions? Are all democratically taken decisions automatically legitimate (what about minorities\\' rights?)? How should all citizens in a democracy participate in politics? By direct self-government of the people or by voting representatives? Is everything democratically decidable or does the individual have unalterable rights?

    "ClassOverview": "Subtle mistakes in reasoning can get us into trouble, especially in philosophy where reasoning can be very intricate. Logic symbolizes arguments to make subtle mistakes easier to spot, and intricate arguments easier to follow. In this class we will first learn how to use symbols to represent certain natural language sentences. The symbolization allows us to give step-by-step reconstructions of arguments. When these step-by-step symbolized arguments have a certain profile, they represent good arguments. When they don't have that profile, the corresponding arguments can go wrong---and we can devise examples of when they go wrong! Throughout we'll address some concepts (such as truth and existence) that are deployed in philosophy, and how logical techniques can help us sort the good uses from the bad.",

We will ask: Are there objective truths about what is valuable - or about anything? Does life have a point or meaning? What should one try to get out of life? How should we think about death? Is each person the final judge of what is good for that individual, or is it possible to be mistaken about where one\\'s good lies? What is the relationship between living well and being moral? How important is pleasure? Since more good is better than less, should we aim at all times to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number?",

Hegel argued that communities over time develop a value-laden form of life that is shaped historically and collectively, that contributes in essential ways to individual and social well-being, and that is not under individual or conventional policy control. In this course, we will study the concept of embodied ethical life as it appears in Hegel and in those contemporary philosophers and critical theorists who are interested in similar issues. We will ask questions like: How are social practices and institutions formed and how do they change? What does it mean to say that a social practice or institution embodies, instantiates, or reflects certain values? In what ways might embodied ethical life contribute to or detract from human flourishing? Ultimately, our goal is to explore the possibility of a broadly Hegelian alternative to purely normative approaches to political philosophy like those offered by Rawls and his critics?an alternative built on the premise that conceptions of the good or right, including conceptions of justice, cannot be understood or evaluated apart from their embodiment in social practices and institutions.",

    "ClassOverview": "Power, Sex, and Knowledge (Michel Foucault)This course introduces one of the most influential late-twentieth-century French philosophers, Michel Foucault, and his ongoing importance for contemporary studies in philosophy, critical theory, gender and sexuality studies, and critical race studies. The primary texts studied are: History of Madness, Discipline and Punish, and History of Sexuality, volume one. It explains Foucault's development, throughout his work, of fundamental Foucauldian concepts such as : otherness, the historical a priori, epistemic conditions and epistemic rupture, discourse,  archaeology discipline, normativity,  biopolitics, power-knowledge, resistance, and genealogy, many of which have become central to inquiry and critique in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. The course provides a transition to advanced studies in these areas. It does assume prior knowledge, and is the opportunity for a more systematic engagement with Foucault's overall work, for those who have encountered this thinker briefly in other courses.Thematically,  the course will consider Foucault's writings on madness, the medical gaze, prisons and related disciplinary institutions, the association between sexuality and truth, and Foucault's critique of a number of modern understandings of freedom, selfhood, knowledge, and resistance.The course is reading intensive. In addition to weekly excerpts, you should plan to read your choice of one of Foucault's major texts throughout the quarter, and to reflect on your choice of one line of contemporary criticism (or modification) of Foucault from a range of suggested fields that include gender and sexualities studies and critical race studies.The course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students. In fall '21 we are able to offer a dedicated graduate discussion section (Wed 8 pm).",

We will explore communicative mechanisms that can be used to protect vulnerable groups from expressive harms and ways in which the communicative agency of marginalized groups can be safeguarded. We will examine how expressive harms and communicative injustice have been analyzed and evaluated in different bodies of literature: analyses of hate speech (Butler, Sosa et al.), discussions of speech and harm (Maitra et al.), and the literature on discursive injustice (Kukla et al.) and hermeneutical injustice (Fricker, Medina, and Pohlhaus).",

Physics is the most basic of the sciences, dealing with the behavior and structure of matter. Lectures illustrate physical principles: mechanics, motion, momentum and energy, fluids, and oscillations. It continues as PHYSICS 130-2, 3. Students taking this course must also enroll in a Physics Lab 136-1. Actual demonstrations of many physical principles will be shown in the lecture whenever possible. Weekly quizzes emphasize problem solving. The goal of the course is for the student to gain an understanding of the nature of the physical principles which govern the world around us and the universe beyond, through models which draw on our everyday experiences.

Given the broad sense that the rule of law is a critical element of good governance, international actors have become rule of law promotors. Is the rule of law something that outsiders can help to create or improve? Can one create a rule of law if governments or powerful actors refuse to subordinate themselves to the rule of law? How do those actors committed to the rule of law try to balance the aspiration of a rule of law and the political reality that governments and powerful actors have a variety of ways to resist? Participants will be divided into five country groups: South Africa, India, Colombia, China and the United States. All of these countries have constitutions and supreme courts, and all face rule of law challenges. The comparison will allow us to consider the variety of challenges that exist, and the country perspective will help us to consider what, if anything, outside actors can do to support the rule of law.",

Local, state, and federal governments as well as other governing bodies (e.g., the NCAA, universities) regulate who can participate (raising questions about eligibility and equality) and what standards athletes must meet (e.g., drug testing, academic performance). These organizations also oversee economic issues (e.g., resource distribution) and symbolic issues (e.g., mascots). Ideally, governing policies would be responsive to the wishes of their constituents (players, owners, voters), but are they? How would we know? How do we gauge their opinions? Alternatively, how do sports affect public opinion? Do citizens prefer politicians who engage in sports? Do media portrayals of sports affect what citizens think about race and/or gender? Is it appropriate for athletes to use their notoriety to make political statements? These are the kinds of questions we will consider in this class. This involves learning the science of public opinion polling and applying it to study opinions about public policies relevant to sports.",

The course opens with a consideration of the massive military buildup and assault on Iraq in 1991. The American military presence in that region never went away. This presence provides us with a framework for analyzing the changing character of warfare. Consideration of the Iraq War (2003-2011) focuses on the development of counterinsurgency and the emergence of multi-domain warfare (i.e., political warfare, information warfare, etc.) and increased reliance on low-profile Special Operations Forces. Our attention then turns to recent challenges of hybrid warfare (i.e., hacking and fake news and their roles in conflicts), and the advent of flexible responses such as increased American reliance on drones and contractors in the conduct of warfare. The course ends with the consideration of several emerging American war-fighting strategies.",

This means that you should leave this class with the ability to think, write, and speak about political theories and their relation to laws and legal obligations, as well as strategies for challenging or resisting prevailing political intuitions and their institutionalization. You should be able to understand and defend your own interpretations of political conflicts, violence, and law. To do so will require you to become familiar with key historical events relevant to contemporary debates about the rule of law, speech, and religion, to which much of the lectures will be devoted. Assigned readings include works by Plato, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, and Frantz Fanon. Please note: this class requires you read about 100 pages of political theory weekly, on average. This is a course for those who enjoy reading and discussing challenging texts. The course begins with a close reading of passages from Plato's Republic. Although the authors wrote in very different times and contexts, a throughline will be following different ideas about sovereignty, and attending to their tensions.

    "ClassOverview": "In this course we will analyze canonical political theoretical texts in conversation with contemporary U.S. jurisprudence and politics, paying special attention to themes of sovereignty, nationalism, war, the rule of law, speech, race, religion, and resistance. The objective is for students to acquire the knowledge and competencies of a responsible citizen. This means that you should leave this class with the ability to think, write, and speak about political theories and their relation to laws and legal obligations, as well as strategies for challenging or resisting prevailing political intuitions and their institutionalization. You should be able to understand and defend your own interpretations of political conflicts, violence, and law. To do so will require you to become familiar with key historical events relevant to contemporary debates about the rule of law, speech, and religion, to which much of the lectures will be devoted. Assigned readings include works by Plato, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, and Frantz Fanon. Please note: this class requires you read about 100 pages of political theory weekly, on average. This is a course for those who enjoy reading and discussing challenging texts. The course begins with a close reading of passages from Plato's Republic. Although the authors wrote in very different times and contexts, a throughline will be following different ideas about sovereignty, and attending to their tensions. Each week please reflect on whether the author's objective is a state with a primary goal of institutionalizing identities of sex, nationality, or race; advancing justice (or thwarting injustice); or creating power instrumental to protecting individuals' safety, property, or flourishing. Which authors' commitments and aspirations do you find most inspiring and most objectionable?",

Rather, they are practices that help us to closely read texts and engage critically with theoretical concepts. They are methods of reading and writing that help us connect theoretical concepts and data; they are tools that help us to better explain and understand politics. Interpretive methods are also strategies that help us to think contextually, critically, and historically about how knowledge is produced, what gets to count as evidence, and what our role as researchers might be. This course draws on interpretative strategies and reading practices from political theory, critical theory, critical race theory, critical legal studies, feminist theory, and other fields that have shaped how we understand and value interpretation as a method.",

    "ClassOverview": "Modernity is a time of enormous changes in human thinking and ways of being in the world. A relatively short period in history?conventionally, we situate Modernity between the 17th and early 20th centuries?Modernity nonetheless gave us virtually everything we accept as normal today. The modern state developed during this time, but also capitalism, democracy (as popular sovereignty), ideas of equality and individual autonomy, social sciences and modern scientific thinking. We inherited a world (our world) from Modernity, but we often don't know how or why it happened. Even worse, we tend to accept this world or at least some of its aspects (e.g. nation-state, capitalism) as natural and inevitable. (ironically, this naturalness is also Modernity's invention!)This seminar aims to unsettle and complicate the modern world we inhabit. We will do so by surveying some of the foundational texts in Western political thought that replied to, and shaped, the debates about political authority and its legitimacy; the best way to organize politics; the relation between state, society, and individual; the shape of human history and future possibilities. While we will pay attention to each author's context and motivation for writing?this will help us to see what conditions produced the concepts that we use today and ask whether those conditions are still relevant?our general approach will be to treat these authors as interesting strangers. That is, we'll dive into their arguments trying to see their merits, internal contradictions and weaknesses, and most importantly, relate their ideas to our own experience and contemporary problems. We'll take it as a given that the questions they ask cannot be easily answered (if at all!), and that sometimes the most we can take from them is a bunch of interesting questions/ideas, a good conversation, and a slightly more complex understanding of our world.",

The course will devote attention to theories of the family and intergenerational identities that animate attachments to race and nationality, as well as comparisons among deportation policies in different regions and epochs.

We will learn about how the U.S. 1980 Refugee Act, a national policy premised on human rights obligations in the 1951 International Convention for the Protection of Refugee and 1967 Protocol structures the admission, reception and placement of refugees in United States, consider the politics of who we admit as refugees in public discourse and study how refugee policy meets the street in neighborhoods and other localities in the United States. We will consider what local understandings of refugee policy can teach us about the meaning of integration as part of broader discourses on constitutional governance, federalism and civil society. Through a case study, we will also look comparatively at the refugee policy of other countries to consider alternative perspectives, policies and ideologies and the interconnectedness of the international refugee protection regime. Through these explorations, students will gain insight into the complexities of refugee policy and, more specifically, asylum and refugee resettlement as a durable solution for refugees seeking protection. Students will gain exposure to discourse and narrative policy analysis, analyze data and have a chance to conduct archival research on localities.",

What constitutes threats to those interests and what constitutes a defense of those interests? This course will examine the function of the national security establishment (from the National Security Council to the U.S. military and intelligence communities) and security institutions (from NATO to the UN Security Council), the role of military power, economic power, and, more recently, cyberpower in the promotion of national security, and the future of national security strategy.

We will consider the constitutional responses of other democratic countries such as the U.S., Canada, India, France, Germany, Great Britain, South Africa and Australia to the challenges of capital crimes, right to life/abortion, terrorism, racism, gender disparities, religious discrimination. In learning about the varying traditions of written and unwritten constitutions, civil and common law and the foundations and structures of separation of powers and judicial review of the constitutionality of laws in these countries, students will learn to think critically about the U.S. Constitution and the different ways in which constitutional democracies provide for public order, counter-majoritarian governance, equality and protection of the rights of minorities through rule of law and question whether constitutional solutions can address the kinds of social and political problems we have today.",

In response, a sophisticated architecture of global governance has emerged, including through the establishment of hundreds of multi-lateral treaties to confront these threats. As a consequence, nation-States have begun to cooperate with each other to an unprecedented extent, although not without facing significant obstacles, and not without domestic political agendas sometimes delaying or thwarting progress at the international level. This class examines the array of legal regimes, politics, governance processes and policy tools that have emerged in the arena of global environmental law and politics. We will focus on a number of different discrete international environmental problems, as well as how international environmental law is formulated and enforced at the international level.Assignments will include drafting of UN resolutions and simulated UN General Assembly debates and a mid-term examination. There will also be substantial small-group work to engage in interpretation of treaties.",

When an individual holds multiple identities that have traditionally been marginalized, any discrimination experienced will be different than someone without that unique blend of identities. To use Crenshaw's initial example in 1989, Black women experience a different type of racism than Black men, and a different form of sexism than White women. Thirty years later, researchers still are coming to terms with what this means in the public sphere, but also in research which underlines the importance of thinking about identity more comprehensively and completely. In this class, we will begin by addressing the question of what intersectionality is. We will also consider how considering identity as intersectional alters our understanding of policy, and what policy should address. Importantly, we will consider how to incorporate intersectionality into a basic framework of research and analysis through a term-long project.",

No matter how democratic, every society is marked by profound inequalities. Not only are wealth, power, and privilege distributed unequally, but they appear to have remained so or are actually getting worse despite the rise of democracy. Theories of oligarchs and elites attempt to make sense of these puzzling patterns and trends. Does democracy really challenge social, political, and economic stratification? Or does partial equality in the political realm serve to strengthen and legitimize inequalities in other realms of social life? This seminar takes on these important questions from the ancient to the modern era. We will examine a range of cases and countries, with a special emphasis on the US where elite theory arose and oligarchic theory has re-emerged. Students have consistently found this seminar stimulating and relevant to modern political life. This has only increased with the struggle over domination by the 1% (a metaphor for the power of oligarchs and elites).",

In particular, it addresses the political dimensions of social inquiry; one might even say the political philosophy of social science in connection with claims that criticism' or critique is essential to social inquiry. The seminar will broach these issues and claims by attending to the changing traditions of Marxism, Pragmatism, and Critical Theory (associated with the Frankfurt School). These traditions have complex and intersecting histories. At different times, they critique and criticize, not to mention challenge, condemn, or complement one another in a process of mutual transformation. In different ways, they situate critique and criticism within the defining categories of science, method, and politics. It is the intent of the seminar, then, to investigate these traditions involved in mutual critique and criticism, and to take up their respective and changing understandings of critique and criticism in matters of inquiry, as a contribution to the political philosophy of social science. As a matter or organization and presentation, the readings will unfold more or less historically, from the 1840s down to the present.",

What does it mean to study politics ?from below'? What insights about politics can be generated by approaching power from the perspective of peoples' everyday engagements with political issues and collective action problems? Through this hybrid seminar-practicum, we explore ethnography in theory and practice, as methodology and as method, with particular attention to the ways in which ethnography disrupts and destabilizes our understandings of politics and power. This graduate seminar will be of particular interest to students seeking to explore and understand how immersion contributes to the study of power across multiple topic areas and through multiple subfields. The course readings will draw from exemplar ethnographies and discussions of methodology and method from political science, sociology, and anthropology. Students will design an ethnographic project related to their primary area of interest and practice conducting ethnography.

The course will focus on the contemporary framework for defining mental illness - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (now in its 5th edition) - with a particular focus on some of the problems that have emerged from the disease-based framework utilized in the manual, and the assumptions that it makes about disorders and typical development. We will explore the role of state mental hospitals in the U.S. in the early to mid-20th century, and we will examine the political forces that drove the de-institutionalization movement of the 1970s and 1980s, with additional consideration of the contemporary implications of the closing of state hospitals. Finally, the course will focus on the evolution of psychotherapy in the modern marketplace, and some of the challenges posed by the demands of the health insurance industry and academic research. The aggressive way in which the DSM has been marketed internationally and the implications of culture for diagnosis will also be discussed. Along the way, we will explore critiques of the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance industry, and modern psychiatry. Some of these themes will also be explored through analysis of popular films and other media.

Do today's young women feel more empowered than previous generations? Does the modern woman have the power to choose her own definition of femininity? What forces help shape girls' understanding of their own sexuality, social roles, and future opportunities? We will read work by psychologists, sociologists, journalists, ethnographers, and other scholars who present divergent points of view on gender roles and feminist psychology.

Music can serve as a mode of artistic expression, a method of relaxation, a means of influencing mood, and an avenue toward transcendence. This course will focus on the human experience of music by integrating research and theory from cognitive, social, and developmental psychology. Special attention will be given to topics such as the perception of music, the development of musical expertise and creativity, the effect of music on cognition, the emotional impact of music, and effective musical instruction.",

The topics we will cover include research methods, the biology of behavior and emotion, perception, memory, thinking and problem solving, emotion, social influences on behavior, personality, and psychological disorders. A combination of class lectures, readings, and laboratory experiences will convey a sense of the foundational questions and methods of the science of psychology. Ultimately, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill knowledge of the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of a laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have firsthand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must use the paper requirement to satisfy your laboratory credit.",

In approaching this question, we will examine three basic social motives, Belonging, Understanding, and Controlling, and explore how these motives influence how we explain our own and others' behaviors, how we form and change our attitudes and opinions, how we are influenced by the groups to which we belong, and what compels us to help or hurt those with whom we interact. At the end of the course, we will then discuss some ways in which the answers to these questions are relevant for addressing a variety of social problems. Course meetings will primarily consist of multimedia lectures with as many impromptu discussions as I am able to inspire.The course will involve both asynchronous activities (e.g., videos, exercises) for you to complete on your own and weekly synchronous meetings where we will discuss the material in more depth. To facilitate engagement, there will also be periodic quizzes and discussions using the classroom interaction systems TopHat and Packback, so even if you don't like talking in big groups, you will still have opportunities to participate. Evaluation will also be based on short-answer questions that you will complete weekly and submit online. You will prepare the answers to these questions using your class notes, textbook, or any other outside sources you choose. There will also be a take-home final-exam that covers all of the material in the course due during finals week.",

This theory of mind influences not only how we interpret what other people say, but also how we use language to communicate our own desires and thoughts. In this class, we will read and discuss a selection of original theoretical and empirical literature related to theory of mind and linguistic communication. Class sessions will be held synchronously, and will be heavily weighted toward weekly discussion of empirical and theoretical papers in psychology, and participation is expected. In addition to written responses to the class readings, you will also write a final paper in the form of an empirical research proposal.",

The approach will be conceptual; it is my aim to take the middle ground between a more mathematically rigorous course which you might find in the Mathematics Department (or some of the more statistically-oriented courses in our department, such as those offered by Professor Bill Revelle) and a mere cookbook course. The primary aim is to convey a conceptual understanding, not to memorize formula or to provide rigorous proofs. There will be no matrix algebra, for example. I also want you to get a good idea how these techniques are used and reported in academic research.",

The focus will be on the practical skills and knowledge required to design and teach a successful undergraduate course in psychology. Many of the assignments for this course are designed to result in material that can be used in a professional teaching portfolio when applying for faculty positions. Topics will include course design and creating an effective syllabus; methods of assessment; grading and feedback; writing and delivering engaging lectures; leading meaningful class discussions; designing and evaluating activities and assignments; building more inclusive classrooms; and working with challenging students. In this course, students will develop and articulate their own statements of teaching philosophy; create a course syllabus; observe and evaluate classes taught by master teachers; create exams and assignments; and practice giving lectures. We will focus on practical issues that commonly arise in undergraduate psychology courses and best practices for teaching difficult concepts in psychology. This course is meant to compliment other resources available on campus, such as those offered by the Searle Center for Advancing Learning and Teaching. All course readings will be available on Canvas. This course will meet once per week. This course is graded on a pass/fail basis.",

And, for that matter, many people who we might describe as Christian didn't call themselves Christian at all. In this seminar, we explore one of the most pivotal moments in world history: the generation of a religious identity that would grow into the world's largest religion. When did people first start calling themselves Christian, and what alternative history of Christianity does that help us to write?This is also a first-year seminar, so in the process, we'll familiarize ourselves with research methods and models appropriate for historical work. This includes (1) framing the right size of research question; (2) understanding what count as reliable primary and secondary sources; and (3) producing strong versus weak arguments.",

This course introduces students to the Hebrew Bible by reading sections of most of the Bible\\'s books. But reading is itself a complicated enterprise. The Bible has been put to many different uses; even within the world of academic scholarship, the Bible is sometimes a source of history, sometimes a religious manual, sometimes a primitive legal code and sometimes a work of classical literature.This course will introduce students to the various challenges that present themselves within the study of the Hebrew Bible and the varied approaches scholars take when reading the Hebrew Bible.

We will see, in fact, that far from being a relic of the premodern world, blasphemy takes on its sharpest and most coercive forms in modernity.

What habits of mind and heart ought/might the scholar of religion cultivate? How are these habits best nourished?

We will look at contemporary issues in Russia and the Ukraine as these relate to sociolinguistic issues, the question of fascism particularly with respect to the annexation of the Crimea, censorship of Pussy Riot and women within society, and more.  Issues to be examined include: language and identity, language discrimination, language vs. dialect, and language and nationalism.  We will read and discuss topics on life at college, including: making the most of learning and studying, recognizing and knowing when and where to ask for help and support (and how this is a strength, not a weakness), determining, setting, and achieving academic goals, and academic integrity. We will also try to take time to learn about Northwestern's campus (both for practical and other kinds of reasons) and about different Northwestern resources that are there to help you in your goals and your time while you are at Northwestern.",

After Stalin's Great Terror, successive Soviet rulers alternated between thaw and freeze, seeking to find what they saw as the proper balance in their efforts to control the Russian narrative and thus ensure the survival of the regime. They forced writers either to put their talents at the service of the State, or to go underground. In the late Soviet period and then under Yeltsin, the regime began to allow more free debate (glasnost). But then with Putin, repression returns, but with a focus on those who dare to use mass media to oppose the regime's controlling national narrative.",

In the process of writing this paper, you will practice identifying a theme you find interesting, formulating an argument, finding data and source material on the internet from China in English translation, and relating your theme to the scholarly literature we read and discuss together in class.  Some of the progress you will make in your writing abilities will be technical - what counts as evidence, what is the difference between data and scholarly texts, how do you cite and give credit to those who preceded you; some will be intellectual - how do you refute and how do you prove, how do you evaluate your own argument to be clear about its limitations, how do you assess the political relevance of your theme; and some of it will be emotional - how do you cope with the panic that is welling up when you are expected to tame the chaos of reality into a tidy argument, how do you cope with disappointment and ire when I tell you that your second draft is not good enough, how do you cope with your self-doubts when you are trying to find a needle of evidence in the haystack of the internet under time-pressure?The Chinese have achieved enormous economic growth over the last forty years which has dramatically raised living conditions in China.  The Chinese Communist Party has steered this economic development through authoritarian rule which denies the Chinese liberties you take for granted.  Thirty-one years ago, the Communist Party killed Chinese who demanded these liberties by employing the military inside the country.  Since the massacre of 1989, protest in the streets has moved to networking on the internet.  You will write your paper about this challenge to authoritarian rule by engaging some of the following questions: How have urban Chinese lived with the trauma of the massacre?  What exactly happened in 1989?  Making and uploading videos to the internet is a crucial weapon for activists.  How do you evaluate the power of individual videos to force political change?  These videos are documentaries, performance art, interviews, covert recordings of state agents, cries for help of fugitives in real time, and witness testimony.  The creators of these videos are prepared to take risks because they feel there is something wrong with China today.  These feelings are value judgments, or valuations.  How do you tease out the values by which activists judge the state and evaluate their lives in China?  What in turn are the value judgments of American reporters who report on Chinese activism to the American public?  What are the value judgments of American professors who study Chinese activism?  And what are your own value judgments: If it turns out that U.S. capitalism in its combination with democracy cannot economically compete with Chinese capitalism in its combination with authoritarian rule, and you were forced to choose, would you choose capitalism or democracy?  What parts of your life would be impossible under authoritarian rule?  Which line would populism and neo-authoritarianism in America have to cross for you to fight the government?",

    "ClassOverview": "Sociology is a field of study that examines how people and groups interact, navigate, and make decisions within the structure and constraints of their social world. Often these social processes go unobserved or unacknowledged, and sociologists treat it as their job to shed analytical light on how people experience and participate in society. Through sociological analysis, we can answer questions like: How did Evanston become largely segregated by race? Why is it illegal for people to sell their kidneys? Is suicide contagious? Why would someone pay for Instagram followers?Sociology is a huge field of study, and includes and enormous variety of topics and methods. Each week, we will focus on a specific area of sociological study (Culture, Gender, Race, Family, Money, Deviance, etc.) with the goal of offering you a general overview of the types of questions sociologists ask and how they answer them. By the end of the quarter, you will be able to think sociologically about your own world, and hopefully develop a budding interest in one or more of the areas we discuss in class.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course examines the recent history of capitalism around the world, and is meant to whet your appetite rather than to provide comprehensive coverage.  We examine four historical topics: what communism was, and why people fear it; why there is more poverty and inequality in the U.S. than other developed countries, and whether this is a problem; how some developing countries have managed to become rich; and the rise of the financial sector in the American economy, at the expense of manufacturing and services.  We then close with an examination of the racialized history of capitalism, and students are asked to use everything they have learned in the course to think through solutions for questions of the current moment.",

    "ClassOverview": "The gender division of labor is a key organizing principle in all known societies, but it takes a fascinating array of forms. In industrialized and post-industrial societies, women have increasingly taken up paid employment and moved into formerly-masculine fields, driven by demand for women workers as the economy shifts toward the service sector, and more recently by feminist movements.  Yet women are still doing the majority of caring and household labor, while men's take-up of traditionally feminine caring labor has been far more limited.  Moreover, the sex segregation of occupations and substantial gendered earnings gaps remain.  Meanwhile, much of the work formerly done by housewives has been outsourced to paid service workers, many of whom migrate from global South to global North to take up this work. Scholars debate about whether and how these arrangements will change, and whether they may be influenced by political initiatives, either top-down (e.g., affirmative action to recruit women to STEM fields) or bottom-up (e.g., cultural and media campaigns to validate new norms).  In this course, we will investigate the ways in which work - paid and unpaid, in families and in places of employment - is organized by gender and other forms of power, difference and inequality, such as race, class and migration/citizenship status.  We will examine family divisions of labor across diverse households:  how do men and women divide domestic work and care for children or others needing care? Where does non-familial provision come into play?  What are the consequences for outcomes in paid employment and in terms of the distribution of time, respect, and power? We will learn about the development of the modern economy and occupational sex segregation, as well as how different kinds of men and women are treated at work.  Finally, we will consider the role of government policy in sustaining or changing these arrangements.  By the end of the course, students should understand how gender influences the kinds of work we do and how it is rewarded, how gender interacts with other forms of difference and inequality, how the economy is organized along gendered lines, and how public policies and political processes shape the gendered world of work.",

For the most part, people learn to do fieldwork rather than being taught to do it. On the theory that learning to do fieldwork is more a matter of being socialized rather than of learning techniques, the course is arranged to provide a concentrated exposure to fieldwork. Through your own and your colleagues' field experiences and four quite different books by fieldworkers, you will be exposed to a wide variety of field settings. These monographs and your own experiences will also provide us with a common base to draw on in reflecting on the methodological and ethical issues addressed in the pieces on how to do fieldwork and ethnographic writing.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course is motivated by the assumption that knowledge and technology have become central to the social, cultural, political, and material organization of modern societies. The fundamental goal of the course is to develop intellectual tools to understand not merely the social organization of knowledge, science, and technology but also the technoscientific dimensions of social life. Although much of the course content concerns science and technology, the theoretical and analytical frameworks developed in this course are intended to apply to any domain involving knowledge, expertise, technologies, or formalized techniques. How might sociology as a field of study benefit from closer engagement both with epistemic concerns and with the material aspects of our technosocial world? We will examine: why we believe what we believe (the politics of knowledge production, circulation, and reception); the impact and uptake of technologies and the assessment of technological risks; the character of life in expert-driven knowledge societies; the resolution of conflicts around knowledge and technology (and the use of knowledge and technology in conflict resolution); the encounters between and across different knowledge systems, ways of knowing, and epistemic cultures, both locally and globally; the use of technologies to tell us who we are and where we belong; the social and technological reproduction of inequalities, including those related to social class, race and ethnicity, gender, sexuality, location in global hierarchies, etc.; the relations between activists and experts, and the tensions between expertise and democracy; the roles of social movements when intervening in debates about knowledge, science, and technology, as well as the use of knowledge and technology by social movements; and the nature of governance in technologically sophisticated societies?including the character of collective decision-making about knowledge and technology, as well as the uses of knowledge and technology to arrive at such decisions. A lot (but not all) of the course content focuses on the United States, though we will try whenever possible to place developments in a global context and we will benefit from comparative and postcolonial approaches to STS. While much of the scholarship we will consider is broadly sociological, some of it is drawn from other fields, and part of the goal of the course is to suggest the interdisciplinary character of STS. Students from other disciplines are welcome.",

The course will be comparative across the Indigenous communities, European colonial structures, routes of African enslavement and Black freedom movements, and contemporary nation states of Latin America, and also include some comparative attention to racial structures in the U.S., especially as highlighted by transnational migration and scientific and cultural exchange. We will pay special attention to the intersecting structures of class, gender, ethnicity, and region, among others.

How do we forge ahead with our dreams if others do not share our values or goals? Cervantes' Don Quixote tackles these big questions in ways that are both moving and funny as it narrates the adventures of the bedraggled hero--a man driven mad by reading too many fantasy novels--and his earthy sidekick Sancho Panza. The novel contains themes that resonate with our lives today, exploring not only what it means to write--and read--fiction but also asking us to evaluate what kind of person we want to be in the world. In our class, we'll read the novel closely and debate how its essential questions can shape our personal choices moving forward.",

    "ClassOverview": "Immigration has become one of the ?hot' buttons of contemporary social and political dialogue. Through the prism of the Latina experience in the United States, this class will explore causes and consequences of global migration in the 21st century, analyze the marginalization of third-world immigrants in first-world society, and seek to develop an understanding of the evolving ?face' of America.  Students will further examine how their individual experiences and backgrounds help shape their perceptions of this new world order.Latina immigrants to the U.S. often leave intolerable circumstances and brave life-threatening border crossings in pursuit of the American dream. Yet, those who succeed in crossing the geographic border almost inevitably find that the marginalized existence they hoped to leave behind takes on an equally powerful form in their new world as they face economic, political, racial, and cultural barriers north of the border.Issues to be explored include:Immigration: global attitudes and experiences in a post 9/11 worldDangers: physical and psychological dangers risked as Latinas cross both geographic and social bordersRacism: the role race plays in creating barriers for LatinasStereotypes: images and misconceptions of Latinas in American film, television, media, etc.Traditions: how attitudes and practices within the Hispanic community itself impact LatinasChallenges & Triumphs: women who have successfully ?crossed' the border and what that meansPersonal Journey: students will research personal histories (How did I get here?) in order to understand how cultural, social, and ethnic backgrounds impact the formation of attitudes and perspectives.",

Although the new narrative is often identified with the Boom era--when Latin American literature exploded onto the world stage--and with Boom novels, we will take a broader view to consider the diverse types of texts that represent important new currents in the region. Focus on works by writers such as Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cort?zar, Rosario Ferr?, Carlos Fuentes, Rigoberta Mench?, Manuel Puig, Ana Mar?a Shua, or Luisa Valenzuela.",

Students will be able to improve their oral and written Spanish, as they familiarize themselves with the Spanish modern literature as well as the main currents of literary criticism. We will think in and out of the canon of Spanish literature with a critical approach. Issues such as the construction and deconstruction of authorship, the audience, literary genres, avant-garde experimentation and censorship will be discussed. Novels, poetry and plays are analyzed in their political and cultural context, with an emphasis on the impact of empire and post-empire, the feminist movement, Spain's inherent multi-culturalism and plurilingualism, border location between Europe and Africa, working-class activism, Fascism, queerness and transgression. This course provides a foundation to further study literature and culture in more advanced courses.",

A significant feature of the colonial legacy in the Western hemisphere is the idea of nature as an infinite source of raw materials or something dangerous and wild to be tamed (either with divine help or by modern reason). Such paradigms informed the economic and cultural development of Latin American republics. Currently, the environmental and social crises the region faces are calling us to question them. This class will focus on late-twentieth and twenty-first century works that expose violence and ecocide to challenge these colonial and modern conceptions of nature.This class will offer the students the opportunity to explore both academic and creative assignments (creative writing, and other projects TBD) as valuable ways to convey critical thought.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course proposes to explore both the philosophical idea of representation in modern aesthetics as well the visual culture practices that have contested the racial and gendered regime of the aesthetics - resisting being reabsorbed into on the condition that difference be reduced to minor inflections of equivalence. If Aesthetics has historically been the realm of thought where universalizing claims of political and self-determining subjecthood demarcated the threshold of the human (and aesthetic) subject in and of representation: how have unfreedom, subjection, social injustice been defined in relation to representation? Taking the Block Exhibition Who says Who Shows, What Counts: Thinking About History as a survey of the compelling stories that can be told through works of art, we examine not only who and what gets represented and/or erased but also what constitutes visibility in visual culture, historically and down the present. We interrogate the power dynamics within which the racial and gendered regimes of representation have regulated access to recognition, by fundamentally de-naturalizing the ways in which these regimes have taught us to see. Closely exploring particular works of art, we ask what the experience of seeing yourself represented in or by an artwork involves and means. How it dramatizes the lived experience of being included or barred from social recognition, institutional legitimacy, political agency?",

    "ClassOverview": "In this class we will read a selection of literary works (in translation) produced by Brazilian writers, works which came to constitute, to different degrees, a queer archive (and, for some critics, even a canon of Brazilian gay literature). We will focus on the turn of the nineteenth century (roughly 1880-1922), a period in which writers were arguably obsessed with normativity and dissidence. By doing so we will be interested in asking the following questions:1. How is the knowledge of a queer past produced and institutionalized (or not), and what are the political and epistemological advantages and limitations of addressing or confronting something like a queer archive?2. Considering that the end of the century has been associated with the alleged invention of the homosexual, on the one hand, and in the case of Brazil, with official ideologies of whitening and nationalism, on the other, how do we conciliate ideas of queer temporality with historical periodization?3. What are the specificities of studying a selected corpus when most records of the past are extremely precarious, not yet available nor preserved, catalogued, or translated, and when their promises and possibilities are already vanishing or always under the threat of physical and ideological destruction?",

These include: Newton-Raphson, Monte Carlo and Metropolis methods. The data augmentation methods rely on an augmentation of the data which simplifies the likelihood or posterior distribution. These include: EM, Data Augmentation, and the Gibbs sampler. All methods are motivated and illustrated with real examples. Overall, this course provides the student with a good introduction to the field, the ability to read application papers, and the ability to apply these methods to problems of interest to the student. Students understand at a heuristic level how the methods work and when a given method may be preferred over another.",
