    "ClassOverview": "An aptitude for musicality counts among the few positive stereotypes commonly directed toward the diasporic Gypsy or Roma peoples of Europe. The practitioners of distinct folkloric musical traditions, the Roma have been evoked in the Western classical tradition since at least the eighteenth century through a system of gestural stereotypes, and such representation continues today in the marketing practices of the world music industry. How has the music of this minority been appropriated, mimicked, and altered over time? What is the relationship between the folkloric musics of the Roma and their evocation in other repertoires?This class will attempt to answer such questions by focusing on a variety of repertoires performed or inspired by the Roma people, especially Roma music from Hungary and Spain, and also from the Balkans, and its roots in India; Andalucian flamenco; 19th-century opera (Bizet'sCarmen, Verdi'sLa traviata); instrumental works by Haydn, Liszt, Brahms, and J. Strauss; Django Reinhardt; and more recent \"world\" music phenomena such as the Gipsy Kings and other popular songs. The relationship of Roma identity to the writings of Cervantes, Pushkin, Liszt and Bart\u00f3k will also be considered. The classes uses methodologies of historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and popular music studies, in addition to presenting historical context of the Balkans and Eastern Europe.",

The focus will be on a primary locus of controversy: the \"meaning\" of music and the formal implications of this meaning for the musical work.   Topics include the rising importance of one-movement forms such as overture, symphonic poem, and the tone poem; cyclic approaches to multi-movement works, and the debate between proponents vs. opponents of program music.  We will also consider social issues such as the burgeoning middle class of musical consumers, the rapid growth of orchestras, the rise of musical scholarship and the concommitant awareness of the history of music, the increasing influence of nationalism; the emerging concept of \"repertoire\" (with its related issues of \"the canon\"); questions of gender, sexuality, and race; the growing split between \"serious\" and \"light\" music; orchestration as a distinct discipline; issues of performance practice such as the role of the conductor and the arrangement of the orchestra; and innovations in the design of musical instruments such as harp, clarinet, and trumpet; and the addition of new instruments (saxophone, \"Wagner\" tubas, etc.).",

This graduate seminar will survey and conduct new research into American art song traditions, including African American song, with special focus on poetic language and issues of performance. It will query intersections between classical art song and popular cultures and religious practices, and attempt to define elements that differentiate American song from other traditions in English. A core repertoire of songs by Charles Tomlinson Griffes, William Grant Still, Charles Ives, Amy Beach, Samuel Barber, Florence Price, Margaret Bonds, and Ned Rorem will be balanced by attention to lesser known and, if possible, unpublished material. The seminar meets once per week and is aimed at voice, piano, and musicology graduate students.

SIA is an evolving hybrid that sits (unstably and contingently) at the intersection of music composition, sound design, and various contemporary art practices. In view of the latter, useful points of reference can be made to the genres of sound art, sculpture, installation, architecture, and relational art. In addition to lectures and class discussions, students will be required to conceive of and propose a sound installation project. They will then develop, prepare and present their proposal; selected proposals will advance to the stage of actual realizations, to be presented during final exam week.One of the clearest examples of a boundary condition for an artwork to be an installation is that situation where the artwork engages in and integrates a discourse with the place where the artwork is experienced in such a way that the place is itself made into an essential element, and which supersedes conventionally received ideas of the nature of the role of the site. For example, in the cases of classical music or rock or jazz presented in concert hall venues, while the specific hall certainly influences the sound via its acoustic characteristics (reverberation etcetera) that hallis by convention understood as being external to the music that is presented inside it. In comparison,Times Squareby Max Neuhaus cannot be separated from the specific place in New York City where it is located; to do so would destroy the work, and would destroy the experiential understanding of the work.",

They will then develop, prepare and present their proposal; selected proposals will advance to the stage of actual realizations, to be presented during final exam week.One of the clearest examples of a boundary condition for an artwork to be an installation is that situation where the artwork engages in and integrates a discourse with the place where the artwork is experienced in such a way that the place is itself made into an essential element, and which supersedes conventionally received ideas of the nature of the role of the site. For example, in the cases of classical music or rock or jazz presented in concert hall venues, while the specific hall certainly influences the sound via its acoustic characteristics (reverberation etcetera) that hallis by convention understood as being external to the music that is presented inside it. In comparison,Times Squareby Max Neuhaus cannot be separated from the specific place in New York City where it is located; to do so would destroy the work, and would destroy the experiential understanding of the work.",

    "ClassOverview": "Among the most remarkable developments in the music theory of recent decades have been the rapid advances in the study of rhythm and meter. Initially propelled by exponents of the Schenkerian theory, these advances were more recently fueled by representatives of the cognitive study of music, neo-Riemannian theory, and historical music theory, among others, and they brought about a rich inventory of analytical tools applicable to variety of musical repertoires. In this course we will review the most important theories of rhythm and meter developed in the last forty years and apply them in analysis of common-practice repertoire. This combination of theoretical inquiry and practical application of analytical methods is reflected in the course design, in which in-class discussion of readings will be followed by analytical exercises. The assessment will include preparation for and participation in the discussions, one presentation and two analytical papers.",

Nimmer, Cases and Materials on Copyright and Other Aspects of Entertainment Litigation, Eighth Edition, 2012, published by LEXIS/NEXIS. The latter one third portion of the course will center largely on selected cases and other source materials that will be available on Westlaw (or will otherwise be supplied or made available to you).Students should come to class having prepared the reading assigned for that class, ready for discussion. Informed discussion of the ideas embodied within the reading materials is one of the objects of this seminar.  Class participation will count towards the student's final grade.  For each class, a number of cases or materials, identified below, representing a portion of the assigned reading for that class will form the basis for the class discussion.  Familiarity with all of the assigned reading for that week, however, will be assumed. Each class session has designated \"Additional Readings\"; these are NOT mandatory or required in any way, but are helpful resources and will provide additional context for the materials discussed in that particular class.  Also, you can count on being advised of new developments during the semester via email and Canvas; as you will see, this is a volatile and dynamic area of the law. Class attendance is not mandatory but useful, given the wide-ranging nature of class discussions and the scheduled presentations; given that the class is a seminar, contributions by students form a material part of the class content.   Due to the class schedule and calendar constraints, we anticipate one or more \"make-up\" sessions during the semester.   You will be notified in advance of these sessions.  BE PREPARED for alterations in the scheduled class content; we may have outside guest-lecturers; you will get notice of these alterations.The principal course requirements will be (1) a paper (counting for approximately 70% of the final grade), on an approved topic, and (2) three graded, hands-on, practical projects, which will be administered in three different class sessions, counting for approximately 30% of the final grade.  As stated, class participation will figure in each student's final grade so that component will have some influence on class attendance.  Paper topics should be selected as early in the semester as possible.  Papers will be due not later than the last day of the exam period.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course addresses foreign law. Not only does foreign law matter to U.S. lawyers in international business or international arbitration, but it is important within national law (consider Chicago litigation involving a contract governed by French law or a Miami resident bequeathing real estate in Italy). Indeed, a comprehensive ABA survey reveals that after 7 years of practice, 44% of U.S. lawyers report work involving foreign law, a figure that reaches 66% for lawyers in large firms and 65% for those working as inside counsel. However, the \"handling\" of foreign law raises formidable challenges. Is meaningful interpretation of foreign law even possible for a U.S. lawyer? How to optimize one's understanding of foreign law? Are there methods, techniques, or strategies that can overcome differences across laws, languages, and cultures \u2014 that can give reliable access to foreign law's singularity? How best to proceed, and what can be achieved? Meanwhile, many claim that U.S. courts can rely on foreign law in adjudication. Is foreign law legitimate normative authority in the United States? Note that this course, despite its focus, finds itself effectively ranging beyond the issue of foreign law. This is because many of the insights derived from an examination of the hurdles attendant upon foreign-law interaction also prove useful in situations involving national law only. No prior knowledge of foreign law or of a foreign language is assumed or required.",

    "ClassOverview": "Judge Learned Hand famously once remarked: \"Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it. While it lies there, it needs no constitution, no law, no court to save it.\"To be sure, Hand was hopeful that a fierce commitment to liberty - along with a constellation of other critical constitutional values -- did course within the American people, reflecting and cementing the protections provided under law. But if Hand's optimism was (and is) well-placed, it bears asking: How have these constitutional values been forged within American hearts, minds, and culture? How have public conversations, discussions, and debates about the meaning of the United States Constitution unfolded? And what might those exchanges, located in our past, reveal about how Americans view the Constitution's guarantees within their own lives today?This course, focused on American public constitutional discourse, will address these questions. Specifically, we will assess and compare the public persuasion dimensions of an eclectic series of constitutional controversies. Fusing legal history, rhetorical criticism, communication research, political science, and constitutional theory, we will analyze the public arguments advanced by advocates during these episodes, the methods used to do so, and their success or failure with key public audiences.We will also investigate the discursive manner by which Americans - in print and at the podium, and across legislative hearing rooms, law school classrooms, and family living rooms -- have built a constitutional culture, and the degree to which that public culture: (a) informs individual and community expectations regarding freedom, democracy, and equality; (b) reinforces core constitutional precepts of rights, judicial legitimacy, institutional balance, and the rule of law; and (c) reflects, invites, and shapes the exercise of citizenship.",

The course is not intended to teach you how to draft any particular type of contract (e.g., employment agreements, asset purchase agreements, limited liability company operating agreements), but rather to introduce you to the basic contract concepts and organizational structure that most negotiated commercial contracts share, as well as give you practice spotting issues in contracts drafted by others.Although you will be exposed to, and work with, existing agreements relating to previous deals and other types of contract \"precedent,\" the focus of the course will be on teaching original contemporary contract drafting. You will be taught how to draft agreements in a formal, but modern, style free of archaic language, redundancies, and legalese.",

We will trace the evolution of the federal system from one grounded in principles of rehabilitation (as reflected in the framework of indeterminate sentencing and parole that predominated for much of the 20th century) to one focused on retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation (demonstrated by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the creation of the United States Sentencing Commission, and the implementation of mandatory sentencing guidelines).After this initial exploration, the class will turn to a more practical review of the mechanics of sentencing. We will study the relevant statutes and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that govern sentencing submissions and proceedings. We will then review selected Sentencing Guidelines, with a focus on those guidelines regulating drug offenses. In conjunction with this discussion we will touch on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, the Holder and Sessions memoranda, and the First Step Act.The class will be co-taught by a seasoned criminal law practitioner and former staff attorney at the Federal Defender for the Northern District of Illinois, Doug Whitney of Douglas Whitney Law Offices LLC. Prosecutors, defense attorneys, and members of the United States Sentencing Commission will visit the class to offer their perspectives on sentencing law and practice.",

Working with an Ethiopian NGO and U.S. and Canadian partner NGOs, we'll be continuing advocacy efforts on behalf of an indigenous Guji community that is suffering devastating effects due to toxic contamination (mercury, arsenic, etc.) from the Lega Dembi gold mine. Details of what we'll do depend on evolving circumstances, but we may write submissions to UN human rights mechanisms, continue our efforts to force the government to make public the results of impact assessments, utilize European laws and regulations or industry self-regulatory standards with respect to the supply chain obligations of the Swiss refinery that has purchased the gold from this mine, and explore possibilities within the African HR system. 2. We have been asked by two women's rights NGOs in Myanmar to analyze the results of a survey questionnaire on the security situation of women in Myanmar following the military coup, to write a report based on these results, and to engage in international advocacy using the report. 3. We are collaborating with EQUAL GROUND, a Sri Lanka LGBTIQ NGO, to prepare submissions for the UN Human Rights Committee and the UN Human Rights Council's UPR mechanism regarding human rights violations against LGVTIQ people in Sri Lanka.  4.  Working with the newly-founded Geneva-based International Platform for Corporate Liability, we will continue work begun last year to determine whether grounds exist to hold corporate actors in the gold and diamond sectors criminally liable for complicity in crimes against humanity in the Central African Republic. 5. We may add another project - perhaps in collaboration with a legal clinic in either Arequipa, Peru, or Tbilisi, Georgia.  Do you have an idea of a HR project you would like to work on? I am always open to student suggestions for projects that are suitable for this clinic, though whether we can proceed with an idea this coming semester depends on time demands of all projects.",

Subjects covered include planning for the marital deduction; use of the gift, estate and generation-skipping transfer tax exemptions; annual exclusion and other lifetime gifts; planning for IRAs and other retirement benefits; grantor trust planning -including sales to grantor trusts, installment notes, grantor retained annuity trusts and personal residence trusts; charitable planning with  charitable lead and remainder trusts; business succession planning, asset protection planning, and the use of family limited partnerships and limited liability companies. An examination of the efficacy of these techniques and a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages will be an integral part of this course. Current developments, fiduciary duties and powers and ethical issues will also be carefully considered.",

The hope is not to necessarily become great artists, but rather learn to quickly and effectively communicate ideas with others. We are going to design things that are disruptive and imaginative in an effort to create the future, and in order to do so, we have to be able to help others see what we see.We will explore the process of generative ideation as fueled by design sketching as well as presentation methods for communicating design concepts effectively. We will focus on user experience, human emotion, form and the use of materials in design and develop multiple concepts across a range of industries. We will also imagine and develop ideas at a range of scales, from handheld products, to large architectural installations. We will also work to develop your unique sketching style and aesthetic.We will work in a studio culture involving a fast-paced work environment, peer-review, and an opportunity to learn from a wide variety of resources. Reading and exercises will be provided on a project-by-project basis and you will also be encouraged to explore other types of visual communication that you find interesting in the development of concepts.",

It is intended to help students of engineering, design, applied science, and the useful arts explore and understand their critical role in the invention/creative process and ultimately yield insight on the technologist's role in wealth creation.After an introduction to innovation from the perspective of economics and strategy, we explore the subject of invention and intellectual property. All issues relating to patents and patentability of inventions, copyrights and the protection of the expressions of ideas, trademarks and source identifiers will be reviewed and analyzed in the context of multiple engineering domains. While these domains will initially be functional (mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, computer science, etc), we will explore how new combinations of traditionally functional knowledge (e.g. ME+CS, CS+CE, IE+CE\u2026) are the fertile areas of new commercial markets and wealth creation.",

Recently Python has become practical for coding in embedded systems, as well. Embedded microcontrollers are relevant for our annual robot design competition, NU engineering teams (Solar car, Baja), internships, and experimental apparatuses.  Our approach to coding emphasizes algorithm creation, debugging, methodical creation and partitioning in a modern notebook framework, as well as hardware-level access for microcontroller applications.

The skills set required of an aerospace engineer is a combination of mechanics (solids and thermofluids), materials science (advanced composites; ceramics; polymers), and control systems. This course will cover essential topics in these areas relevant to aerospace engineering. A term project will allow the students to explore (design/analyze) simple aerospace systems (drones, gliders etc).Why Aerospace Engineering: Unmanned aerial vehicles are increasingly becoming important for both military and civilian applications. In the space sector, the US has embarked on an effort to privatize space launches. The demand for engineers with aerospace skills set is therefore likely to increase in the coming years.",

    "ClassOverview": "Nanoscale Thermal TransportThermal energy storage and transport at the nanoscale occurs through the interaction of electrons, phonons, and photons. The objective of this course to address five fundamental questions namely, (1) how is thermal energy distributed among electrons and phonons? (2) how fast do the carriers move through a material? (3) how much thermal energy do each carrier hold? (4) how do the carriers scatter as they move through a material?, and (5) how do the carriers interact with material boundaries and interfaces? The answers to these questions will provide a basis for understanding the conduction of thermal energy in solid-state nanomaterials, and the design and control of thermal processes in heat-transfer, thermoelectric, thermionic, thermophotovoltaic devices and solar cells. In the classroom, I will introduce the Landauer transport formalism and use it to elucidate the fundamental limits of heat conduction between two contacts/reservoirs by electrons and phonons, and to explain the dependence of thermal conductance on energy, frequency, wavelength, and material size. Homework problem sets will be assigned to facilitate deep learning of the course material and journal article reviews will be used to highlight new thermophysical insights on heat conduction in 1D and 2D nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes, nanowires, graphene, molecular junctions, etc.",

Active teaching duties will be assigned during the course and performance feedback provided.Who takes itThis is a seminar course taken by ME graduate students to improve their skills of teaching, seminar presentations, technical and proposal writing. The seminar course is required for all ME PhD students.What it's aboutThis course meets once per week, and each session is run by different faculty members in an innovative forum to address the syllabus topics. The purpose is to expose students to a variety of skills necessary to advance as a researcher during and after their PhD studies. The topics of teaching and technical writing and presentation are incredibly important in a student's future success and yet are seldom taught in a systematic fashion in standard PhD curricula. This course addresses this need by tackling these topics drawing on the expertise of our own faculty. The course is about 1/2 seminar and 1/2 interactive discussion. Some sessions are run as panel discussions and in several areas students will actively participate and be provided feedback on their performance by the faculty. Areas for student activity include preparation and presentation of a short mini-lecture on a research topic, and writing a proposal for a research or teaching lab need.Contact: Malcolm MacIverProfessor: e-mail: maciver@northwestern.edu",

Companies need to engage and persuade employees to be brand ambassadors with customers, the community where they work and among fellow employees. A key part of reaching employees results from effective leadership communications using trusted leaders.The world has changed over the past few years, making the task of aligning, engaging and motivating employees even harder. Today's workforce is more diverse and companies need to seek greater diversity and inclusion. There are different levels, education, ethnic and generational cohorts in most companies. There are different languages spoken (even in the United States, English may not be the primary language). Employees may be in one location or spread out around the globe, a growing number in virtual offices. Many companies expect to continue to offer greater flexibility after the threat of Covid 19 is over.Reaching employees and communicating with them requires a strategic approach along with a variety of skills. Students will learn how to understand a dynamic employee audience, how to determine what's important, how to create a workplace environment conducive to mobilizing the employees to act effectively and in concert, how to deal with change in the organization and in the work environment, and how to lead when there's a great deal of turbulence and uncertainty.Beyond the employees, companies need to be active participants within the communities where they operate. This requires an ability understand strategically which NGOs to reach out and collaborate with, and ways to collaborate to benefit both organizations. Often, employees want to participate because they know maintaining healthy communities helps them keep social structures functioning well. Millennials and Gen Z entering the workforce are looking for companies, which have strong social responsibility commitments and offer ways for employees to participate.",

In addition, it will also provide connections to corresponding international Indigenous environmental issues, and the responses and debates across science research, news and international policy contexts.The seminar focuses on how the media cover Native American environmental issues and how that coverage contributes to the formation of public opinion and public policy. The seminar provides the critical tools to analyze current environmental struggles; to understand the controversies within a cultural context; and to make informed decisions about issues that affect us all. The central case study of the seminar will be water and fishing rights for Indigenous Peoples, and how they are part of larger land rights issues.Over the past two decades the issue of tribal sovereignty has become front-page news. From major confrontations over pipelines affecting Tribal Reservations mobilizing Indigenous people and their allies around the world, to battles over whaling rights and mining of tar sands, to sulfide mining adjacent to Tribal Reservations, to disputed land claims in the Northeast and battles in the West over water, fracking, and grazing,  the rights of Native governments to exercise their sovereignty remains in the new century at the cultural, political, and legal core of American contemporary history.These and many more issues\u2014air and water quality standards, treaty rights, and land-into-trust\u2014have contributed to tension between Native and non-Native communities, and have become the subject of news reports, in both mainstream and tribal media. The goals of this seminar are to understand how tribal sovereignty and treaty rights inform contemporary environmental issues; to identify source selection, bias, and framing in mainstream and tribal media accounts; to analyze and critique mainstream and tribal media accounts for accuracy and bias; and finally gain intercultural knowledge and competence through a final project that explores the intersection of Native environmental issues and the media.",

It is designed to tell true stories about one of the most complex and emotional challenges any diverse community faces.

We will pay particular attention to Evanston, while also considering Minneapolis, the site of George Floyd's murder in 2020, the resulting protests, and a serious effort at police reform.  We will build our expertise through rigorous reporting and thoughtful interviews with players on all sides of this enduring debate. The historical record is central to the equation, as is politics, especially with Evanston becoming one of the first cities in the country to pursue reparations for past racism, and Minneapolis drawing national attention. The class will make a reporting trip to Minneapolis in May. This workshop, taught by Peter Slevin, a contributing writer for The New Yorker, will start with questions, not answers.

    "ClassOverview": "This course introduces you to Native American environmental issues, such as treaty-based hunting, fishing, and gathering rights; air and water quality issues; mining; land-to-trust issues; and sacred sites with a particular emphasis on the First Nations in the Great Lakes region. In addition, it will also provide connections to corresponding international Indigenous environmental issues, and the responses and debates across science research, news and international policy contexts.The seminar focuses on how the media cover Native American environmental issues and how that coverage contributes to the formation of public opinion and public policy. The seminar provides the critical tools to analyze current environmental struggles; to understand the controversies within a cultural context; and to make informed decisions about issues that affect us all. The central case study of the seminar will be water and fishing rights for Indigenous Peoples, and how they are part of larger land rights issues.Over the past two decades the issue of tribal sovereignty has become front-page news. From major confrontations over pipelines affecting Tribal Reservations mobilizing Indigenous people and their allies around the world, to battles over whaling rights and mining of tar sands, to sulfide mining adjacent to Tribal Reservations, to disputed land claims in the Northeast and battles in the West over water, fracking, and grazing,  the rights of Native governments to exercise their sovereignty remains in the new century at the cultural, political, and legal core of American contemporary history.These and many more issues\u2014air and water quality standards, treaty rights, and land-into-trust\u2014have contributed to tension between Native and non-Native communities, and have become the subject of news reports, in both mainstream and tribal media. The goals of this seminar are to understand how tribal sovereignty and treaty rights inform contemporary environmental issues; to identify source selection, bias, and framing in mainstream and tribal media accounts; to analyze and critique mainstream and tribal media accounts for accuracy and bias; and finally gain intercultural knowledge and competence through a final project that explores the intersection of Native environmental issues and the media.",

    "ClassOverview": "Whether facing a lack of government transparency while covering the Covid-19 pandemic, exercising your rights to report on massive community protests, or navigating the contentious, often wildly fact-challenged partisanship of political debates, the demands on today's journalists require more than ever an understanding of the legal and ethical principles necessary for the practice of authoritative journalism. Further complicating the reporting environment is the rising hostility toward the media, partly the result of deliberate attempts to undermine journalistic credibility, which has led officials and the public to increasingly turn to the courts to attack journalists and suppress information. This course will review the laws, legal cases and ethical standards essential to being a journalist in the 21st Century -- not only for what you report and publish, but also for what you post on social media -- including defamation, privacy, information access, protecting confidential sources, and copyright.",

    "ClassOverview": "The president of the United States is forced to resign. Evidence of genocide is unearthed. Tax money meant for the poor is pocketed by the people entrusted to help. In each case, investigative reporting has played an essential role, and over the years, it has proven to be one of the highest forms of journalism: shedding light on wrongdoing and exposing corruption at the highest levels. In this dynamic course grounded in real-time investigative reporting, students will expose a problem of significant national or international importance and chronicle its effects on the lives and livelihoods of those most impacted, particularly those in disenfranchised communities. Throughout the winter and spring quarters, students will take on one critical subject using the tools honed by investigative reporters: documents, data and sources. Students will dig deep and learn on the go, reporting on a complicated topic, synthesizing findings and writing or producing a compelling, long-form investigative story suitable for publication. In the past six months, students at the Medill Investigative Lab have published more than 15 stories in The Washington Post, focused on the impact of COVID-19 in America's nursing homes. The stories have prompted calls for investigations by members of Congress. The winter course is a primer: Working remotely, students will devote a tremendous amount of time digging for information and framing stories. In the spring, students will report out stories on the ground, traveling when necessary and if possible. This course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students; students will work as a team and with the professor to report, write and produce stories.

We will build our expertise through rigorous reporting and thoughtful interviews with players on all sides of this enduring debate. The historical record is central to the equation, as is politics, especially with Evanston becoming one of the first cities in the country to pursue reparations for past racism, and Minneapolis drawing national attention. The class will make a reporting trip to Minneapolis in May. This workshop, taught by Peter Slevin, a contributing writer for The New Yorker, will start with questions, not answers.

Students will work on a longer feature (with approval from the instructor you can pursue projects already underway), along with a couple of shorter writing assignments which we will workshop in class. We will also read some of the best nonfiction writing out there, and dissect those stories so we can come to understand how a writer builds a story, from conception to writing.

The seminar discussion experience of integrating different key voices builds from the discussion of critical treaty-based rights that were negotiated as part of the foundation of US as nation-state, into issues related to air and water quality, mining, land-to-trust status that connect territorial rights to many other human and cultural rights.

The central case study of the seminar will be the impact of mining in Wisconsin Indian Country, Menominee Nation and the Back 40 Mine Project, to address the impact of mining and energy on territorial rights for Indigenous Peoples, and how they are part of larger land rights issues in Indigenous Peoples territories that also involve oil and gas pipelines, dams, and infrastructure development at urban micro to large rural scale.",

Whenever possible, examples from Qatar and other economies in the Gulf region will be used to illustrate the material being discussed. The content and delivery of the course are suitable to students who are not pursuing a major in economics. Topics are discussed in a relatively non-technical way. Analytical explanations will focus on graphs rather than mathematics.",

    "ClassOverview": "During the last two decades, social media has transformed Journalism. On the one hand, it has given news professionals an unprecedented capacity to engage in meaningful conversation with their audiences, which provides them with valuable insight to better understand the public, their preferences and their news consumption patterns. On the other hand, social media has enabled journalists to tell stories across a wider range of platforms, personalising their news offering, and reaching different demographics. Social Media has also come with challenges. Twitter, Facebook and news aggregators, such as Google and Apple News, are now users' preferred news providers, even if the content is produced in mainstream media organisations such as the NYT or the BBC. This trend has seen advertising revenue shifting from mainstream media to online outlets, and from legacy organisations to social media platforms.With these developments in mind, this practical course introduces students to the use of social media for news gathering, production and dissemination. Through engagement with social media platforms such as TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, students will learn how to produce news, curate and verify information, engage with audiences and gain followers, do live reporting and social listening, and crowdsource investigations. Finally, this course will also train students to deal with toxic comments online and trolling.",

How can our thinking about something affect the nature of the things we think about? What are the historical developments and social forces at work? Does the claim that something is socially constructed mean that it is not real? We are also going to think about the political and ethical implications of the idea: Does the claim that something is socially constructed undermine its authority? What is the problem with essentialists claims about race, gender, disability, etc.? Does social construction mean that \"anything goes\"? What should we do with the things that turn out to be socially constructed -- keep, reform, or abolish them? We are going to explore these question in a number of different areas, which may include race, gender, sexuality, disability, mental illness, money, and power. In addition to systematic philosophical texts, we are going to read texts that situate these phenomena in concrete social and historical contexts.

We will take a close look at the evolution of religious content in popular media (including entertainment, journalism, and religious broadcasting) and examine how this all relates to what is loosely called \"globalization.\" We will also consider methods to produce case studies of major media stories that started as or evolved into religion-based narratives, mainly Islam, such as ISIS's use of digital media; reactions and counter-reactions to the Charlie Hedbo shootings; Western discourses appropriating religion for political advantage; and appraisals of media handling of such flashpoints as the Chapel Hill murders, South Carolina church shootings, post-elections intimidations, and more.

Students will be exposed to the work of anthropologists, sociologists, historians, journalists, aid workers, policy makers, literary authors/artists, and voices of refugees themselves.

In this course, students will learn how to identify the value systems and ideologies communicated through mobile interface design. To do so, students will learn a formalized, systematic way to observe and analyze one or more mobile applications of their choice. Through research and observation, we will develop an original argument about how that app communicates its values. We will learn the language of technology research and design, take a critical eye to the interfaces we use everyday, and develop skills in writing, revision, and giving and receiving feedback.

Consider the last time you: watched a web series, checked your Instagram, read an article shared on social media, tuned into a podcast, or streamed a movie. Now think about how advertising is integrated into your enjoyment of those things\u2014and how you can encounter advertising nearly everywhere you look: billboards, public transit, ad-supported streaming, product placements, sponsored content, etc. It's clear that media are omnipresent in our lives, in one form or another, but what (or who) determines the shape they take? How do they influence our decision-making, and in what ways do they shape our beliefs? Perhaps most importantly, how are important societal issues and ideological struggles represented in the media? In this course, we will explore the evolution of mass media in the West (and abroad) through historical texts and research articles that enhance our understanding of the ways in which mass media has transformed our culture.Beyond offering a theoretical/historical perspective on mass media, the course material should also provide you with conceptual equipment to deconstruct and evaluate new media forms as they emerge, and consider how they might be used to effect change (for better or worse). How might media distort or align perceptions of ourselves and reality? How does it engage and hold our attention? How does it facilitate the transmission of arguments and ideas\u2014and what does it demand of its audience in exchange? This course draws attention to how our collective media habits can shape our individual attitudes and behaviors as well as society as a whole.",

First, through assigned readings and class discussions, we will survey theories and practices of rhetorical analysis in the discipline of communication. We will read analytic works and discuss the perspective that scholars take in studying their chosen subjects. Second, through independent research projects, students will undertake the practice of rhetorical analysis for themselves. The class readings and the independent projects should inform one another; the readings should assist students in inventing their own perspectives and approaches, and students\\' ongoing independent projects should illuminate class discussion. Students who successfully complete this course should expect to be conversant in the disciplinary vocabularies of contemporary rhetorical analysis and should expect to have produced a critical work appropriate for conference or journal submission and/or for a thesis or dissertation chapter.",

We will learn to watch and study dance in its various contexts and to analyze it using both formalistic and theoretical frameworks including movement analysis and attention to representations of race, gender, sexuality, and class. The course aims to familiarize students with a variety of dance practices in various geographic and social settings while building our capacity to think critically about dance as integral to social, cultural, and political structures.",

The course offers us the urgent opportunity to explore the aesthetic foundations of contemporary dance as they have been created and framed by African American aesthetic structures and practices. As with American music, which has been largely influenced by the articulation of jazz, contemporary dance performance has been enabled by participation in structures of Black Dance. The course includes historical overview of key figures, performance venues, and events that have defined the form, as well as important works of art created in this mode.To take on the question of how Black Dance exists, we will attempt to articulate structures of composition and performance that are commonly described as Black. Working with cultural criticism contemporary with emergent modes of Black Dance, we will assess the political motivations and aesthetic strategies of artists and writers working explicitly in this idiom. We will also look closely at current Africanist scholarship that assumes the possibility of Black dance performed by people of First World, European, Latinx, and Asian descent.While this is not a course of dancing, we will dance together at times in the semester.  Hopefully, by the end of the semester, we will come to understand aesthetic structures of Black performance; genealogies of modes of Black dance; and particular histories of several artists and dancers that every educated person might encounter.",

Transitions micro and macro, we use the micro lens of the focus on the local/personal movement/moment to affect not only the larger technical concept being addressed, but the global/spatial movement patterns and the performative aspect as well.  We will address the idea of performing without grafting on any additional frameworks outside of spatial concepts, letting the clarity and truth of the movement concept project itself, finding the humanity in abstraction.  Using total commitment to presence in the fully embodied execution of the moment at hand by integrating the ideas of total presence in repetition of learned material, and use of improvisation in technical exercises to infuse the material with vital energy and urgency, and aid in keeping the focus on the now.",

The class is neither an acting class nor an English class, but it draws on practices fundamental to both. Much of class time will be devoted to performance of texts and rigorous critical discussion of the performances and the works on which they are based. Consequently, attendance is mandatory.

What emerging performance genres\u2014from vaxxies to mental health TikTok videos and from Zoom performances to Instagram livestreams\u2014have taken off during the last two years of social isolation and polarization? What digital aesthetic strategies link personal experience to collective crisis and action? How have artists and activists drawn attention to issues such as anti-Blackness, gender violence, and authoritarianism and their imbrication in the current public health crisis? To address these questions, students will read scholarship on performance and new media, examine digital performances of their choosing, and produce critical essays and/or practice-based research projects that incorporate digital tools. By the end of the course, students will have gained skills to analyze digital performances, to think critically about liveness, embodiment, and mediated performance, and to share their research using a critical digital humanities approach.",

Politically-inflected entertainment is popular across the global media landscape \u2014 some TV shows and films integrate political issues in their plots, while others frame their commentaries in less explicit terms. Films and TV also may appeal to different viewing pleasures, for example, the Netflix show Squid Game and Boots Riley's film Sorry to Bother You both offer prominent, but different critiques of contemporary capitalism. Moreover, different genre conventions contextualize real-world issues in their unique ways. This course examines how different media formats, genres, and modes of delivery of entertainment film and television frame and comment on social and political issues of their times. Through screenings, discussions, readings, and writing assignments, the course will examine both the affordances and shortcomings of the politically inflected entertainment media, in the US and abroad. We will also consider how and with what effects these political elements extend through intertextual connections with video content on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to offer a window into a variety of political persuasions and ideologies.",

Working chronologically, this course will highlight key technological innovations including the rise of early cinema, television, and computers. From Black owned \u2018picture palaces' in the 1910s to Indigenous women creating VR in the 2010s, this course centers an understanding of women, LGBTQ+, and BIPOC as consistent designers and users of emerging technology.Each week will center around scholarly and primary source materials that illuminate perspectives on how gender and race informed the dynamic relationship between users and technology. This approach will attune students to the lengthy history of new media and technology and the unique and recurrent debates that emerge. It will also offer students the opportunity to study and apply critical gender and racial theory approaches in a media studies context. Class assessment will draw from current approaches in digital humanities.

On the other hand, big cities with financial power, cultural and artistic hubs have played a significant role in shaping the film and media industries. In this course, we will explore the close relationship between urban space and the moving image to understand how their histories are interwoven with each other since the beginning of modernity. Focusing on the representations of cities like Paris, New York, Tokyo, and Berlin, we will analyze their portrayals in different forms (i.e. realistic, allegoric, futuristic, or Orientalist) and the symbolic constructions of their environment. We will also examine the conventions, styles, and clich\u00e9s of filming the city and its inhabitants from different social classes, ethnicities, (sub)cultures, and ideologies. Our course screenings will include both canonical films and alternative media texts of different genres and mediums (feature film, TV series, short documentary, and anime) covering topics such as city symphonies, noir and sci-fi cities, gender and the city, ghettos and segregation, displacement and globalization. Finally, we will discuss how new media technologies and digitalization shape our urban space and everyday life and speculate about \"the future of cities\" and \"the next-generation metropolis.\"",

In the middle decades of the 20th century, radio plays were among the most popular forms of fiction in many parts of the world. Legends have come down about thrillers of the 1930s, but these remain framed inside narratives of nostalgia, and are not representative of the broad work of experimental writers in the medium. In this class, you will learn how radio dramas were made in three historical periods: classic American (1937-54); mid-century British (1954-1974) and contemporary podcast traditions, with additional focus on audio dramas in the global south, including South Africa and India. We will explore the cultural and political background of each of these contexts, practice how to \"read\" a radio play, and ask about how the form interacts with various media, and expressive agendas.",

This course explores that dialogue through the history and aesthetics of music video, the film musical, and music- and dance-based digital games. As part of our study, we will hear from industry professionals working at the intersection of music and visual media, with a particular focus on the work of music supervision. With regards to media aesthetics, music has stimulated innovative and influential approaches to audiovisual style, modes of storytelling, and forms of media interaction. Musical genres provide a distinctive perspective on media history as well. For example, music videos helped to define the media culture of the 1980s, launched the careers of many influential directors, and have returned to prominence as music is increasingly encountered on digital screens. The film musical was an early site of media industry synergy, and the compilation soundtrack has played an important role in recent strategies of film promotion. Media texts that center on music and dance foreground the role of performing bodies, and one of our goals will be to sharpen our skills at cultural critique as we investigate the politics of representation, cultural borrowing, and discourses of authenticity in genres of musical media.",

    "ClassOverview": "Writers have the opportunity to grapple with the most complex problems facing our communities. Whether we define community in a local, national, or global context, climate change is radically shifting our world right now. How can the tools of dramatic storytelling be used to combat the issues of climate change? How can writers subvert binaries such as man versus nature or destruction versus salvation to create nuanced, riveting narratives on ecological themes? Utilizing a climate justice lens, we will explore these questions using examples ranging from Chekhov to Don't Look Up in conjunction with scientific, journalistic, and historical research as templates for our own dramatic imaginations. Through weekly writing prompts, writers will generate material for a full-length work (play, screenplay, or pilot) focusing on a discrete aspect of climate change that speaks most directly to them.",

Students will in turn explore these themes in the production of their own video and performance-based work in response to the concepts and artists covered in class.Focusing on different artists each week, we will look at a wide variety of work ranging from traditional performance art in an institutional setting to \"low-brow\" projects that utilize alternative queer modes of circulation to circumvent the obstacles created by those same professionalized art channels.

By breaking down the director's role from beginning to end, the class will offer vocabulary, tools and examples of how a director can knowledgeably and effectively communicate their vision to all the people and departments responsible for fulfilling it. For further inspiration, the class will also analyze the choices and advice of cinema professionals known for their unique visions. Finally, students will create a proof of concept, pitch and project book that communicates their vision for one film.",

From the cinematic city to the TV suburb to the networked places of digital media, the media have a profound relationship to our experience of everyday environments. This class will explore the representation of place in film and television, and it will also consider a range of mediatized lived spaces from the digital smart home to the screened environments of world cities. We'll consider the placemaking aspects of streaming networks, Zoom, mobile devices, VR, and scanning devices, and we'll examine the media's use as a means of mobility, immobility, and surveillance (particularly with regard to gender, sexuality, and race). We'll explore experimental works made by filmmakers, media artists, architects, and designers who produce immersive \"elsewheres,\" or escape routes from surveillance and the dominant spaces of daily life. Readings will include major theoretical works on space and place as well as related readings in film and media studies. Mode of instruction is seminar discussion/lectures.",

What can our sonic tendencies teach us about the ways we inhabit the world and how might we shepherd our cultural productions into a generative critical dialogue with these broader social questions? This class will provide students with a critical introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques of field recording, sound editing, and sound mixing specifically related to documentary cinema production and postproduction. This includes technical training on microphones, audio recorders, fundamental audio concepts (frequency, amplitude, acoustics, polar patterns), sound-image synchronization, foley and dialogue recording, and digital audio mixing for stereo and 5.1 surround sound systems using Pro Tools or comparable DAWs. We will read theory, listen to a great many films, recordings, and art pieces, and produce sonically-minded work both individually and in groups. Class will be split between discussion of texts, practical tutorials, and group critique.

    "ClassOverview": "This course will introduce students to a poorly understood art form that has been reborn many times, including today in the light of pandemic restrictions on theatrical production just recently: audio drama. In the middle decades of the 20th century, radio plays were among the most popular forms of fiction in many parts of the world. Legends have come down about thrillers of the 1930s, but these remain framed inside narratives of nostalgia, and are not representative of the broad work of experimental writers in the medium. In this class, you will learn how radio dramas were made in three historical periods: classic American (1937-54); mid-century British (1954-1974) and contemporary podcast traditions, with additional focus on audio dramas in the global south, including South Africa and India. We will explore the cultural and political background of each of these contexts, practice how to \"read\" a radio play, and ask about how the form interacts with various media, and expressive agendas.",

This course explores that dialogue through the history and aesthetics of music video, the film musical, and music- and dance-based digital games. As part of our study, we will hear from industry professionals working at the intersection of music and visual media, with a particular focus on the work of music supervision. With regards to media aesthetics, music has stimulated innovative and influential approaches to audiovisual style, modes of storytelling, and forms of media interaction. Musical genres provide a distinctive perspective on media history as well. For example, music videos helped to define the media culture of the 1980s, launched the careers of many influential directors, and have returned to prominence as music is increasingly encountered on digital screens. The film musical was an early site of media industry synergy, and the compilation soundtrack has played an important role in recent strategies of film promotion. Media texts that center on music and dance foreground the role of performing bodies, and one of our goals will be to sharpen our skills at cultural critique as we investigate the politics of representation, cultural borrowing, and discourses of authenticity in genres of musical media.",

We will study his biography, from modest origins, to wartime France, to his discovery/invention of what came to be known as the \u2018Theatre of the Absurd.' We will read his groundbreaking play, Waiting for Godot, with an eye towards its impact on freedom struggles throughout the second half of the twentieth century. We will also read seminal texts like Endgame, Happy Days, and other plays with an emphasis on their varied production history across time, languages, and political contexts. This course is about what it means to dig deeper beyond a canonical name and unpack the influence of one of the twentieth century's most brilliant and innovative theatrical figures.",

The theatre has long provided a rich environment for dialogue regarding technological change and continues to provide a platform for artists to experiment with new technologies that push the boundaries of performance and theatrical form. Can robots replace human actors? How do we perform our identities online? Is it possible to \u2018stage' the internet? In this course students will engage with theatrical works, performance art, and social media to develop research and analytical skills that can be applied across diverse artistic and scholarly contexts. We will consider how these artistic works utilise technological elements to reflect on, and speak to, their particular socio-cultural, political, and historical moment.

In this course, we will analyze Ovid's The Story of Orpheus and Eurydice and Sarah Ruhl's Eurydice, Puccini's Madama Butterfly and David Henry Hwang's M. Butterfly, and Bill T. Jones's Still/Here. We will ask which key themes from the original texts these artists carry forward into their adaptations and how those themes implicate culturally-specific issues.

We will study biblical performances as objects of analysis and performance as a critical paradigm for understanding religious expression in the contemporary United States of America. The first half of the course will explore theatre productions that dramatize the Bible, ranging from traditional passion plays to Broadway musicals like Jesus Christ Superstar and postmodern adaptations like Terrence McNally's Corpus Christi. The second unit will investigate Evangelical projects that use theatrical apparatuses to proselytize across various sites, like Megachurches, Christian theme parks, and Creation Museums. This course mixes lectures, discussions, in class exercises, and co-curricular experiences beyond the classroom to survey multiple intersections of contemporary American Christianity and theatrical adaptation of scripture.",

    "ClassOverview": "The state of storytelling in the digital age is constantly evolving. As new platforms, genres and mediums emerge, digital storytelling has gone from a small component of the content we consume to a major player in the ways that we view new material. As we continue to adapt to the era of digital storytelling, as creators we have to ask ourselves important questions, such as:What is digital storytelling?How does it relate to other forms of traditional media (namely fiction, nonfiction, theatre and film making)?And what tools does it offer us as storytellers that differ from other forms of traditional media?This course will help students to evaluate and create different types of digital storytelling. Building on the skills acquired throughout the theatre major (storytelling, creative writing, and performance), the digital storytelling class would ask undergraduates to design and create their own online stories using different types of media (e.g. video essays, podcasts, social media \u2018stories', etc). Students would spend the first half of the quarter looking at examples of projects that interweave digital media and theatre, and the second half of the quarter designing, writing, and creating their own projects. By the end of the quarter students will have designed, written and created their own original digital storytelling project on a subject of their choosing.",

This course does three things: 1) situates the BAM within the political and cultural history of the United States during the 1960s and 1970s; 2) examines the role of theatre in advancing the goals of the BAM; and 3) considers the relevance of the BAM for theatre in the twenty-first century.",

It is home.\"  The destruction of nature and the climate crises are among the most pressing subjects of our time. What stories might we tell on stage that help capture this imminent threat, and how can our plays take the form of rallying cries to protect the natural world?

    "ClassOverview": "Chicago has long been seen as a mecca for theatre professionals and aficionados.  With the shutdown of theaters worldwide during the pandemic, and the ongoing struggle for racial equity and demands for structural change within the theatre world that both predate (ChiTAC) and came to the forefront during the shutdown (We See You W.A.T.), the question becomes - how is the Chicago theatre community rebuilding itself post-shutdown? This course will explore how long-standing theatrical practices and venues have been questioned and transformed throughout the past two years.  We will investigate theatrical organizations of every size, from Broadway in Chicago to The Gift theatre (these are examples - theatres have not yet been chosen), looking to see how these organizations have adapted/are pushing forward into this new, ready to be transformed world. Will that \"grit\" that Chicago has been known for through the years continue to be its calling card?  Will it retain/reframe its dominance as a \"theatre city?\" And how will/can theatrical criticism take part in this restructuring? In this course we will attempt to tease out answers to these and other questions about theatre's place and function in contemporary cultural and social formations, both within the microcosm of Chicago and at large.  Students will be required to attend a show almost every week (schedule will be provided), read scripts and other related academic/journalistic material, and there will be three guest speakers. Assignments will include a review, a midterm paper and presentation, as well as a final paper.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course will look to the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, disability, and the human to answer key questions about the role of the \"freak\" in the cultural imagination. More specifically: What are the origins of American and international configurations of the \"freak\"? How did we move from \"freakdom\" as the embodied representation of disability and racial otherness on stage in the 19th century to the \u2018freak' subcultures of the 20th and 21st century? And how has the freak been consistently used onstage, in literature, in music, and throughout pop culture as a measure of otherness and desirability? The readings for this course will span from early colonial literature's fascination with the myth of the native cannibal to contemporary music's complex relationship to representations of hyper sexual and gendered performances of the \u2018freak' as both a mode of subjection and a potential site of attempted sexual liberation. This course looks to integrate interdisciplinary modes of analysis in order to form a critique of archival recovery and subjectivity, what comprises the racialized, sexualized, and gendered \"freak\", and how these histories of performance in the latter half of the 19th and into the 21st century were inherently and intimately connected to the shifting cultural and social landscape. The syllabus pairs historical and archival materials with contemporary interpretations, such as archival posters of Saartje Baartman alongside Suzan Lori Parks' play Venus. The syllabus combines visual art, performance studies, theatre history, literary analysis, and other texts to enable students to take a truly interdisciplinary approach to the course material. Texts covered in class will range from TV series American Horror Story Freak Show, Tod Browning's film Freaks, novels such as Song of the Shank, archival materials from the 19th century, the music video for Missy Elliot's \"Get Ur Freak On\", and Deaf West Theatre's 2014 production of Spring Awakening. The goal of the course is to explore how race, desirability, gender, and disability are performed in popular culture.",

For most of us, our initial encounter with the world is in an organization - a hospital, and then most of us spend the bulk of our childhood and adolescences in another organization - a family. We spend much of our childhood and adolescence also attending yet another organization - the school. Most Americans still work in an organization as distinct from being self-employed. Organizations are a fixture in our lives at an early age and continue to play a central role across the lifespan. The ubiquity of organizations is such that we often take them for granted, rarely stopping to consider how they influence our lives. Organizational change has garnered considerable attention from academics, private consultants and policy-makers. This interest cuts across organizational sectors \u2014 for-profit, non-profit, and government organizations. This class focuses on organizational change. Studies in Organizational Change is an advanced course in the Learning & Organizational Change major designed to introduce students to key constructs and ideas about change in organizations. The class is organized as follows: We will begin with a discussion of the notion of change in general and organizational change in particular. We will identify different levels of analysis that scholars who study organizational change focus on. We will then examine different levers or resources for organizational change including - leadership, routines, human capital, social capital, technology, culture, identity and organizational environments. Throughout the class, students will be expected to constantly apply the constructs and ideas to particular cases of organizational change.",

In this class, you'll learn to identify and analyze everyday organizations, document what's working and what's not, and figure out creative ways to redesign them. You'll conduct ethnographic fieldwork, using concepts and methods drawn from theories of human cognition as it happens in context. These concepts come from distributed cognition and actor-network approaches and stress the inextricability of humans and non-humans (i.e. tools, technologies, representations) in the conduct of everyday organizations. The broad goal is to equip you with strategies for making organizational change that can be applied across personal, professional, and community. Course readings are varied and include literature from cognitive science, sociology, anthropology, design, and other disciplines. Classes will be highly interactive, including a mix of discussion of the readings and our experiences in the field, short mini-lectures, and extended group activities.

    "ClassOverview": "In this course, we will explore team dynamics, those forces that influence a team's behavior and performance, and what can enhance or hinder potential for impact. We will analyze the contributors to team functioning and their interrelationships at multiple levels: intrapersonal, interpersonal, group and organizational. Key topics include team development, team make-up and roles, leadership and followership, decision-making, navigating conflict, collaboration and competition, effective communication, content vs. process, diversity and in-group/out-group tensions. Throughout the class, students will be analyzing and applying concepts through case studies and simulations. Assignments to demonstrate mastery include regular written individual papers and a team project. This course is suitable for undergraduate students in LOC, Human Development and Psychological Services, and related majors throughout Northwestern that are interested in leadership, teams/groups or organizational change.",

This course is the most focused on learning of any LOC course. However, in contrast to a typical learning sciences or cognitive science, most of the material in this course is set in organizational contexts. For example, when discussing judgment and decision making, we use examples from medical practice. Experts from each organizational context participate in the relevant class sessions whenever possible. A key component of the class is a group research project on a topic of your choice. Through this project, you will learn about a variety of methods, including instructional design and evaluation of learning outcomes. It will help prepare you to design and evaluate learning programs and learning environments. Thus the course is appropriate for students who might become teachers, researchers, consultants, etc.",

These systems\u2014\"everyday organizations\"\u2014allow us to solve problems, achieve our goals, and generally get things done.  Except when they don't.  In this class, you'll learn to identify and analyze everyday organizations, document what's working and what's not, and figure out creative ways to redesign them.  You'll conduct ethnographic fieldwork, using concepts and methods drawn from theories of human cognition as it happens in context. These concepts come from distributed cognition and actor-network approaches and stress the inextricability of humans and non-humans (i.e. tools, technologies, representations) in the conduct of everyday organizations. We'll also look critically and creatively at the values and principles that anchor our designs for change.  The broad goal is to equip you with strategies for making organizational change that can be applied across professional, community, and personal contexts.",

We then will take an in-depth look at three emerging technologies: personal broadcasting (e.g., blogs, podcasts), Wikipedia, and gaming. In each case, you will get extensive experience with the technology, examine empirical models that can be applied to the technologies, and reflect on how the technologies intersect with your teaching philosophy. The course also provides exposure to a variety of technologies that are common school settings.",

It is the assumption of this course that we will be in a better position to achieve these goals if we can somehow characterize the knowledge that individuals possess at any given time, and how this knowledge changes as they learn.The characterization of knowledge is the business of this course. We will explore the techniques of knowledge representation, primarily as practiced by cognitive scientists. Our goals in this regard are both theoretical and methodological. We will examine various theoretical perspectives on the nature of knowledge, and we will practice various methodological and analytical techniques for studying the knowledge possessed by individuals.The course will be divided into three main parts. We will begin with an introduction to knowledge representation. As part of this introduction, students will learn a \"toolkit\" of knowledge forms that can be used to describe knowledge. This initial exploration will be carried out within a number of learning domains, including mathematics, reading, and science.Then, in the second part of the course, we will employ our toolkit to describe how the knowledge of individuals changes as they learn. Finally, in the last part week of the course, we will explore some additional topics, including the relationships among recent developments in machine learning and studies of learning in the Learning Sciences.",

    "ClassOverview": "In this course we examine what role engineering education plays, has played historically, and could play in mediating dynamics of power, in(equality), and (in)justice in society across global contexts. A wave of recent scholarship has examined the nefarious impact of new technologies on racial equity (Benjamin, 2019; Noble, 2018), social and economic justice (Eubanks, 2018), teaching and learning processes in schools (Watters, 2021), and on the health and survival of the planet itself (Crawford, 2021). Learning about the politics of technologies, and the technologies of power, is thus emerging as one of the most significant needs in education. Building from Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives, in this course we shift our analytic focus to the politics of engineering education institutions (Lucena, 2013; Riley, 2003). What are the historical, cultural, and political forces operating on these institutions? How do they cultivate particular kinds of engineering identities? We will ground these inquiries through case studies of specific engineering education institutions in diverse global contexts (Indonesia, India, Denmark, Iran, Chile, Kenya, and the US). Across the cases, we will carefully examine how themes such as modernization, globalization, nationalism, and militarism have shaped the content, character, and ontology of engineering education. Ultimately, we will work towards a critical, global understanding of the power, responsibility, and possibilities for socially just and ethical engineering education.",

In the third course of the sequence, you will finish data analysis (data summary/data facts), interpretation (weaving together data findings and literature findings), and conclusions; and will pull it all together into a finished master's project.You will be focusing on the data summary and interpretation of the data you collected with respect to your Master's Project question(s). You will prepare a data summary and interpretation leading to conclusions, implications, and recommendations. You will also prepare an executive summary that includes key information, results, recommendations, and next steps from your master's project that can be shared with targeted audiences to easily disseminate your results. You will present your project to a peer audience and invited guests for discussion (the mode of delivery will be determined at a later date -- stay tuned).You will continue collaboration with instructors, peers, and other experts. You have already completed data collection and coding by the start of the course; as well as written at least one section of the data summary at the end of 407.More specifically, 408 will cover the following areas as part of the overall MP course sequence:Continue to analyze, code, and summarize data - learn to display and reduce data, and write a complete data summary sectionInterpret findings and integrate them with the literature review and write an interpretation sectionWrite the conclusions sectionPresent research to an audiencePrepare/organize a polished final written copy of MPComplete an executive summary",

While there are myriad stakeholders who lay claim to each of these issues, the enrollment manager is often the central figure charged with understanding and articulating the policies, practices, and tradeoffs necessary to achieve an institution's objectives around access, enrollment, and retention. This course is designed to provide students with a holistic understanding of the enrollment management profession, beginning with an understanding of the factors that shape student's college choice decisions and extending into the realms of marketing, admissions, financial aid, tuition planning, and retention. In approaching each of these critical areas, the course will focus on theory, policy, and practice through a variety of readings, classroom exercises, and discussions. Overlaying each of the class sessions will be a critical emphasis on understanding why enrollment disparities across race and socioeconomic status continue to characterize our higher education system, and how we might envision a more just society through the development of policies and practices that confront the continued reproduction of social inequality in the American educational system.",

How does the source and type of knowledge interact with socio-political-cultural constructs and systems of power and, in turn, how can \"knowledge\" be used to produce and/or perpetuate power and privilege or to empower those who are marginalized? Finally, how does what we do in SESP and at Northwestern as both consumers and producers of knowledge fit within the landscape of these questions?In this course students will explore these and other questions to gain insight into the social production, distribution, consumption, interpretation, and operationalization of \"knowledge.\" Using primarily seminar-style discussion, the first portion of the course focuses on building and analyzing theoretical frameworks and applied texts in order to generate a working understanding of \"knowledge\" in its myriad forms.  Among our goals for the first portion of the course is to tie theoretical,  academic, and \"folk\" knowledges to everyday experiences and the world around us writ large.  The second portion of the class will involve a series of applied of cases studies, including welcoming members of the SESP faculty community to present on their research, which we will work to bring into conversation with our generated frameworks regarding the sources, types, and implications of knowledge.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course will examine the conceptual underpinnings of the construct of race and the implications (structural, social, psychological, political, etc.) of racialized understandings as relevant to public schooling in the United States. More precisely, we will focus here on historical and contemporary issues of equity in education based upon the divisions of American society according to presumptions around what race means, i.e. what it tells us about who and how people are. Through our 1) generous listening & dialogue, 2) critical analyses of empirical & theoretical data and 3) deep thinking & writing, we will wrestle with a number of ideas and perspectives. Yet, central to this course is knowledge of the myriad, though sometimes nuanced ways that racism has and continues to operate as a tool of exclusion, disenfranchisement and violence towards individual persons and communities. Equally important, are the intellectual, sociopolitical and pedagogical efforts of individual and collective entities to resist, persist and thrive in the face of injustices.",

    "ClassOverview": "How can we design engaging and relevant Holocaust education? How has Holocaust education developed over time? What is its purpose? And what is its future? In this course, we consider and debate the complexities and challenges of Holocaust pedagogy, including responding to learners' emotions and misconceptions. We ask how Holocaust pedagogy can be applied more generally to teaching about histories of atrocity and contemporary injustices. We explore the possible goals of educating about the Holocaust, the merits and challenges of addressing all of the Nazis' target groups, and the relationships between Holocaust education, genocide education, and human rights and social justice education. We study the benefits and challenges of prioritizing specific perspectives, including those of victims, survivors, the second and third generations, rescuers, liberators, bystanders, perpetrators, and collaborators. Through theoretical texts, fiction, film, witness testimony, school curricula, and museum and online exhibitions, we explore appropriate and inappropriate teaching methods and consider the design of training for Holocaust educators across formal and informal learning environments. Student learning is assessed through creative responses to course materials, journaling, and open projects, with opportunities for group work.",

Psychological, interpersonal, social, cognitive, moral and physical development will be studied within the contexts of family, peer group, and school.  Theoretical perspectives will be explored in relation to empirical research, field studies, first person accounts, and imaginative works.  Special emphasis will be given to the adolescent's subjective experience and to the remembered accounts of our own adolescence.  The course will encompass a life course/life span perspective by exploring the period following adolescence proper (often referred to in the literature as emerging adulthood) to include adult midlife.  The course will argue that understanding adolescence is advanced with a corresponding appreciation of adulthood.",

Students are supported through all stages of the design of a year-long independent research project. The quarter will culminate in a complete research proposal that will be put into action during the students' senior year.  In addition to the hard work of design and proposal development, as young and developing scholars, students are challenged throughout the quarter to consider the implications of assuming the role of knowledge producer and to think through the responsibilities inherent within this work.  This process is fostered through thoughtful, critical analysis of published scholarship, evaluation of the costs/benefits and quality of others' work, and careful reflection on the students' own positionalities and design choices.  Class time will include \"how-to\" lectures providing direct instruction on elements of research design and proposal writing, as well as combining seminar style-discussion of theoretical and pragmatic/practical issues integral to high quality research and a workshop format, providing students with regular, real-time, dynamic feedback from both instructors and peers.",

Students will work at their chosen practicum sites Monday - Thursday, approximately 30 hours/week and then attend the weekly practicum seminar on Friday. The practicum seminar will give students the space to reflect on their work experience as it happens and to use those reflections to analyze dynamics in the workplace, in conversation with peers and the instructor. The seminar will help students develop a capacity for critical analysis of organizations and organizational processes, improve observation, research, and writing skills and build personal competence and confidence through workplace experience and reflection.",

    "ClassOverview": "Social policy is integral to the fabric of society. It helps to determine who has access to resources and services, regulates how those are obtained, and is constantly negotiated by changing ideas about public need and the common good. A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation.The first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents.",

We will also identify how to create and move forward with an advocacy agenda. Guest speakers representing current and past elected offices as well as activists, advocates and significant campaign advisors will be a major part of our discussion, bringing historical and current perspectives to our analysis.Students will be graded on class participation, a midterm, a short paper, a speech, and a final exam.

Teacher candidates in the class will be expected to make several small presentations, both to highlight different styles of public speaking, and also to simply grow comfortable speaking in front of others. Interpersonal communication, social emotional learning, and classroom management issues will be discussed. This class will satisfy the public speaking deficiency for licensure and will also count as a graduate-level elective for the Master of Science in Education degree.",

Special emphasis will be given the areas of interpersonal and intergroup conflict as well as strategic decision-making and its links to negotiating.  In addition, interpersonal influence techniques and the tactics and strategies involved with improved bargaining and negotiation will be covered.  The major purpose of the course is for each participant to gain insight into his or her own negotiating style and to become a more effective negotiator, as well as a more astute observer of social processes.  The course will involve extensive use of cases, role-plays, and related participative activities, enhanced by rigorous self-review and introspection.Changes in society, the global economy, and ways people work have made negotiating skills more important than ever.  The challenges are legion:  dealing with history's most diverse work force, doing business with customers who tell you how to run your business, negotiating with foreign counterparts, among other challenges faced in the workplace.  These are not just issues of corporate concern; they are also of increasing importance to your personal success.By participating in this course you will come to recognize the pervasiveness and importance of negotiation.  You will acquire a new repertoire of negotiating skills.  You will develop a systematic and positive approach to negotiating with colleagues, bosses, clients, other stakeholders, external groups of all kinds, and perhaps even in social situations - in ways that equip you to deal with all manner of conditions and circumstances.",

    "ClassOverview": "From JFK to 9/11, to the Deep State and Q-Anon, Americans have always entertained conspiracy theories. Conspiracy narratives have become one of the postwar period's most durable genres, as the popularity of The Matrix, The DaVinci Code, and 24 attest. They have also become an important expression of social anxieties and desires, and an important way to understand the relationship between the individual and the modern state. In this course, students will examine critical thinking strategies and rhetorical choices employed by conspiracy theorists, and will discuss, research and analyze specific cases of alleged and actual conspiracies, reading arguments critically and writing arguments that are persuasive.We'll begin by briefly surveying how disciplines such as psychology, political science, and rhetoric help us understand the appeal and significance of conspiracy narratives. To begin you will give a presentation on a popular conspiracy, and write a rhetorical analysis of a popular conspiracy debate or conspiracy narrative. You will then write your own conspiracy narrative and then begin an original research project that investigates what a particular conspiracy narrative, set of narratives, or debate teaches us about our culture and ourselves. (You might, for example, examine the debate around a particular conspiracy theory like Area 51, the Kennedy assassination, or the Obama Birther Conspiracy). This paper will be pursued in stages that include a proposal, a Sources Examination essay, a conference with me on your draft, culminating in a substantial research-based argument at the end of the term.In the course, students will read arguments critically, and write arguments that are persuasive. Students will build upon what they already know about rhetoric, call upon productive ideas from what they are learning about the world, and bring it together to frame a discussion about conspiracies. Students will also build upon their ability to enter the context of academic research and argumentation.",

You'll push yourself as both a reader and a writer to inquire further into the art form than you have thus far. The readings and assignments will help you do that by exposing you to the different formal, tonal, thematic, and textual elements in poetry. Revision, of course, will be a focus. Types of instruction include lecture, discussion, writing labs, and workshops.Intended for students with little or no formal training in the elements of writing poetry, this course combines both seminar and workshop methods and includes extensive reading of poetry.

But in contemporary culture the protagonists that draw our attention fall often fall far short of usual definitions of heroism, from Walter White in Breaking Bad, to Claire Underwood in House of Cards, to Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones. We will read four short novels--Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground; Camus's The Stranger; Hammett's The Maltese Falcon (turned into a classic film, perhaps the first major example of film noir); and Baldwin's Giovanni's Room--and one long novel, Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride, as well as two short plays, Sartre's No Exit and Beckett's Waiting for Godot. Assignments will include literary analysis papers, with options for the second topic that involve film comparisons. For the major assignment, students will work as individuals or in groups to analyze a television or movie character as an anti-hero, with an oral presentation and video clips; then each student will write their own analysis of that character.",

    "ClassOverview": "This graduate-level seminar explores the origins and development of modern and contemporary Islamic political thought. What is \"modern\" about Islamic revivalism and how does it shape Islamic activism? How did Islamic political thought evolve and adapt to changing political circumstances within Muslim societies in an increasingly globalized world? We draw from intellectual history, comparative politics and political theory to examine some of the major ideological currents, political movements and intellectual figures who sought, since the end of the late 19th century, to reconstruct the political and social dimensions of Muslim societies and countries along Islamic lines. The course focuses on the intellectual origins of the resurgence and spread of \"political Islam\". Our readings include primary sources in translation as well as secondary sources from history, Islamic studies, political science, and anthropology. Topics include: decline and revival, Islamic reform, Islam and modernity, rationality, ijtihad (Islamic legal independent reasoning), Shura (deliberative decision- making), Muslim unity, pan-Islamism, Secularism, Sharia, Caliphate, Fundamentalism, Islamic state, Democracy, Islam and the West, Gender (in) equality, Liberal Islam, Human rights, Violence, Jihad.",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar will investigate the ways in which archives can function as a space for renegotiating the agency of photographs and their (im)material layers, and how these processes can allow for rethinkingarchival practices in complex political, economic and social contexts today.Considering the Arab Image Foundation's (AIF) efforts to critically engage with its research and preservation practices, including documentation, technological solutions and questions around custodianship, rights and access, a particular focus will address diverse methodologies of generating layers of documentation throughencountering and witnessing archival material in specific settings.Additionally, in the course we will be exploring specific pirate or subversive digital projects, traditional/local knowledge archives and their related contracts use of radical descriptions and language which may offer new ways to  reclaim and reassert control over certain narratives. This, in turn, will allow us to understand how reframing the same archival items can shift how people search and read records.For example, in the collections from Burj al-Shamali camp, Yasmine Eid-Sabbagh has over many years tried to give disembodied layers the same status as the material layers of photographs in order to addressthe emotional dimensions of trauma, silence, refusal, resistance and other affects unleashed by these photographs.Looking at the  AIF's Armenian collections will enable an investigation into how dispossession and perpetual migration have defined the presence and absence of Armenians in Ottoman landscapes and how varied methods of documentation might intervene in these historic and contemporary landscapes.The sessions, articulated through lectures, practice-based workshops, and public events, will be led by three members of the current Board of Directors of the AIF: Vartan Avakian, Yasmine Eid-Sabbagh and KristineKhouri.Participants will learn, explore, and generate new knowledge by working on collections from the Arab Image Foundation and related projects.",

How, where and why do we create value? What shapes our decision-making process in making meaning both as an observer and a performer, and how can we practice awareness in these processes? The class utilizes different somatic approaches to movement awareness: Bartenieff Fundamental patterns, Authentic Movement, Feldenkrais, yoga and meditation to awaken the senses to the present moment, the liminal potential in the space between action and reaction. This emergent awareness is then explored in various modalities of performance practice: scored and free movement improvisation, Lisa Nelson's Tuning Scores, Nancy Stark Smith's Underscore, contact improvisation, and others.",

    "ClassOverview": "When first hearing the word \"gothic,\" most would not think of Black authors and visual artists. However, and as acknowledged by several scholars, including the Nobel Prize-winning Toni Morrison, race and particularly Blackness has always been inextricable from American Gothic literature. This course will consider Morrison's claim to explore some early canonical gothic texts by Edgar Allan Poe and Kate Chopin as a foil for how Black authors and artists take up issues of haunting, monstrosity, and corporeal threat since the nineteenth century.While we will spend a little time with white American authors, the center of this class is the production by Black artists. We will begin with the American \"slave narrative,\" stories by fugitive and formerly enslaved Black people. Also, we will look at nineteenth-century gothic fiction and poetry by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Pauline E. Hopkins, Adah Isaacs Menken, W.E.B. DuBois, and Charles Chesnutt. We will also read some twentieth-century gothic texts by Toni Morrison, Tananarive Due, and others. Finally, we will reach outside of the US and look at work by Caribbean and South African writers. The class will also include film, music, and visual art. The core questions of this freshman seminar will include: how the gothic genre succeeds and fails for Black artists; the connections between race, slavery/apartheid, and the gothic; and the relationships between memory, history, and horror in the US and Caribbean.Come to class ready to enthusiastically discuss myriad issues concerning race, gender, class, and sexuality.",

It explores the rise and fall of the regime known as racial slavery coupled with the expansion of transatlantic European empires. Slavery, colonialism, and the violent production of racial difference in and across these imperial economies formed an African diaspora that resisted these conditions of exploitation and unfreedom. Framing the period as a 400-year war for abolition, we show that Black resistance led by rebels, maroons, and organized people, set into motion a wave of abolitionism that began in the 1780s, ignited Civil War in the U.S., and concluded in the 1880s when Cuba and Brazil outlawed slavery.",

    "ClassOverview": "Whiteness refers to the meaning of racially specific, dominating and violating forms of being, seeing, doing and ordering, that define, assemble and rule the worlds of white and non-white populations. Whiteness, whether it occurs under the heading of white supremacy, white privilege or white authority is the meaning that defines just the way things are, a normal state of affairs, like in the phrase, \u2018getting back to normal'. However, of the various populations, groups, communities, ethnicities, nationalities and identities western scholarship in the humanities and social sciences has deemed worthy of legitimate study, it remains the case that whiteness as it shapes and affects both white populations and non-white populations is routinely exempted from analysis. All of which raises the question of how and why this particular white elephant in the nation's room has remained unstudied and understudied for so long, so much so that many white individuals appear to be oblivious to the racial issues of whiteness and their own whiteness, until they encounter people of color. At the same time people of color find so much of their lives involve protracted and difficult encounters and negotiations with institutional and individual forms of racially discriminatory whiteness, that simply cannot be ignored. This course will examine whiteness in four main ways: as the racialization of white populations; as the formation of white supremacy; as the cultural institution of the White Gaze; and as the regime of White Democracy.",

On a global scale, Western societies have historically been largely responsible for developing economic institutions, religious identities, international laws and nation-states mobilized through \u2018race' and socially shaped by racism. Yet at the same time, western cultures have globally represented themselves as exemplars of liberalism, democracy, civilization and universalism as if these ideals and institutions were devoid of race and racism.The objective of the course is to help students develop an effective conceptual and historical understanding of the formative processes and discourses involved in constructing western modernity as a series of racialized polities, cultures and societies. Consequently, this course is not overly concerned with empirical case studies or attitudinal assessments; it promotes a conceptual approach rather than a descriptive one. It will be concerned with explaining the apparent racial discrepancies sand racial injustices of western modernity (e.g. democracies combined with racism, liberalism combined with imperialism) and how those racial discrepancies and racial injustices inform, shape and define western societies like the United States.",

A host of cultural forms and expressions offer a lens for reading the political zeitgeist, alliances, contact zones, exchanges, tensions, dissonances, and, importantly, modes of solidarity between Africans and African Americans. In this course, students will explore how the afterlives of colonialism and slavery has shaped the contemporary relationships between Africans and African Americans. We ask: How have migration, racialized economics, global geopolitics, community activism, and technologies of culture defined the parameters of \"freedom\" and the role of the arts in achieving social change for our communities? Students will explore how writers, musicians, performers, and scholars excavate the ongoing intimacies between the continent and the African diaspora, in a post-Civil Rights U.S. and so-called \"postcolonial\" Africa.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course examines the co-constructed histories of religion, sexuality, and race in the Americas. Drawing upon foundational and newer works in the field, we will explore how the construction of these categories, rooted in biological essentialism, has had immense consequences for the enslaved and her descendants, indigenous peoples, other people of color, and women, queer, transgender, and gender-nonconforming individuals. The historical record shows that individuals born cisgender male and socialized as men, namely white heterosexual men, have historically and contemporaneously dominated and controlled the North Americas and the globe. They have upheld their hegemonic and institutional power by wielding the social constructions of \"gender\" and \"sexuality\" to their benefit, often using religion, and specifically white Christianities, biblical fundamentalism, and \"religio-racial race making\" to regulate sexual bodies gendered and understood as non-white and non-man. This course examines the interconnected histories of race, sexuality and religion in the Americas through the vantage point of African American Studies, and specifically Black Queer Studies, and charts the construction of these categories and how racialized people\u2014both within and beyond religious institutions\u2014have resisted and challenged their centrality.",

Amid converging political and climate crises, humans everywhere are compelled to reconsider how they will live in an apocalypse that is already now. The course begins with Amitav Ghosh's The Great Derangement and ends with Camus' The Plague. In between, we will consider the things humans are doing\u2014and the stories they are telling, to themselves and each other\u2014in the U.S. today and around the world. Readings to include Lisa Wells, Believers: Making A Life at the End of the World; Richard Lloyd Parry, Ghosts of the Tsunami: Death and Life in Japan's Disaster Zone; Kate Brown, A Manual for Survival: A Chernobyl Guide to the Future; selections from Estes and Dhillon, eds., Standing with Standing Rock: Voices from the #NODAPL Movement; Barbara F.

In the 2016 election polls showed Hillary Clinton would win yet Donald Trump emerged victorious in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote. In 2000 George W. Bush also lost the popular vote but he was ultimately chosen the victor. The fallout from the recount and the Supreme Court decision that gave Bush the victory is still being debated and studied. In 2008 America elected its first African American President, Barack Obama and reelected him in 2012.This class will examine presidential elections and how they have evolved since 1952 the first year TV advertising began to have an impact on the races. This class will challenge some of the myths about elections and their outcomes. We will also examine the 2008 campaign, which was dubbed the \"YouTube\" election and was historic by virtue of its outcome, the candidates who ran and the impact the Internet and new technologies had on the race. In 2012 the Obama campaign had the most intense \"ground game\" of any campaign in history, we will examine how the campaign succeeded in this effort. In 2016 Donald Trump bypassed typical advertising methods of reaching voters by unleashing a torrent of Twitter messages, and finding a willing press that was, at least in the primaries, willing to give him uncritical or challenging coverage.",

Many of us watch these shows to relax, to turn off our critical thinking, and to immerse ourselves wholly into some manufactured drama and schadenfreude.  Considered as a cultural text, though, reality television can illuminate some profound truths: about how we decide what is right and wrong, about the tension between written and unwritten rules, and whether anyone can simply be \"here to make friends.\"In this course, we ask what reality TV can teach us about the nature of law.  We'll read and discuss key works in the philosophy of law from H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Ronald Dworkin, Scott Shapiro, and others, and then see how their ideas stand up to the test of shows like Survivor, The Bachelor, FBoy Island, Ink Master, and Bachelor in Paradise.

Beyond being constantly faced with images of our closest living relatives, however, our lives are substantially influenced by our similarities with other primates and how they are interpreted. Whether or not we think of humans as 'just another primate' or as completely unique among the primates can shape our conception of ourselves and our societies. It can also shape our attitudes toward primate research, conservation, and beyond. In this course we will explore perspectives on human-primate similarities and how they influence our understanding of human aggression, xenophobia, gender roles, sexual behavior, and more. Using writing and discussion, we will also explore how unique humans really are compared to other primates. At the end of this course you will have an appreciation for primate diversity and the complex history of primate research. You will be able to describe how different humans really are from other primates, and you will be able to pinpoint how primate research and perspectives on primates influence your daily life. Most importantly, you will be able to explain how science has broad social ramifications.",

Environmental anthropology became more prominent in the 1980s, and is typically characterized by research on communities' engagements with contemporary environmental issues.  Environmental anthropology has greater commitments to advocacy, critique, and application than ecological anthropology, but as we'll see in this course, the proliferation of \"new ecologies\" (as opposed to \"new environmentalisms\") denotes the continued synergy between ecological and environmental anthropologies.This course is divided into two parts.  Part I will provide an historical overview of the development of environmental anthropology.  We will cover some of the most influential research trends in the field: environmental determinism, cultural ecology, systems ecology, ethnoecology, historical ecology, political ecology, and post-humanist ecology.  Part II will then pivot to the application of environmental anthropology knowledge to some of the most pressing environmental issues facing the contemporary world: population pressure, capitalist consumption patterns, biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture, climate change, and environmental justice.",

During the first half of the class, we will explore different approaches to doing ethnographic research by: discussing selected readings from published ethnographies; listening to professional anthropologists describing their research process; and completing in-class and field exercises that will afford students the opportunity to experiment with a variety of ethnographic methods and research tools. In the second half of the course, each student will carry out an ethnographic field project (either individually or in a group).  During class meetings, we will listen to one another's reports about their ongoing projects, and engage in peer review, in-class free writing, and other exercises.  At the end of the quarter, students will submit individually written ethnographic reports that weave theoretical and observational insights together. In addition, graduate students in the seminar will develop a short concept paper for a future independent ethnographic research project.",

We will discuss what the international recommendations for safely managed water are and the health and social consequences of water insecurity. The second objective is explore why there is such variety in water insecurity worldwide. These discussions will be guided by the socio-ecological framework, in which dimensions ranging from the individual to the geopolitical are considered. Influences on access to water will be broadly considered; we will draw on literature in global health, ethnography, the life sciences, and public policy.

    "ClassOverview": "In recent years scholars working in a host of contexts have begun to adopt critical cartography as a toolset to expand on human experience in past and present landscapes. Critical cartography refers to an assemblage of theoretical and methodological approaches, drawn from feminist, indigenous and black geographies, that consider how space and its representation have been used to reinforce or challenge social, economic and political inequalities including but not limited to racialization, displacement, and erasure.  Given these topics, it is no surprise then that techniques including countermapping and participatory GIS have found a ready audience amongst scholars working in contemporary and colonial contexts where the spatial ambitions of the powerful are often asserted through texts, while challenges to those claims can be ascertained through material and historical records. In this course we will focus on the work of scholars mapping critical cartographies in both explicit and implicit ways. While this course will pay special attention the contemporary and relatively recent pasts, examples will also draw on ancient and less familiar contexts.",

In this class, you will learn about the attributes of pre-modern urbanism in the Americas.We will begin this course by studying the earliest experiments with settlement nucleation in the world. Then, we will review scholarship on ancient cities in North, Central, and South America. Topics will include urban configurations, everyday life in ancient cities, how inequality was built into urban space, providing for city dwellers, population and migration in cities, urban institutions, and cosmology. We will discuss the characteristics of ancient Indigenous cities such as Cahokia in Illinois, Tenochtitlan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala, and Machu Pichu in Peru, among others.

    "ClassOverview": "How do histories of violence shape the present and the material world? How are some histories remembered, memorialized, erased, or forgotten? Why do certain places come to signify past events and become sites of political conflict in the present? This class will address histories of state and intercommunal violence, how these histories are remembered and politicized today, and how they are reflected and negotiated through the material world. The course will begin with an introduction to questions of violence, memory, the politics of history, place, landscape, and monuments. It will continue by examining a variety of case studies from different geographical areas. The various examples and contexts will exemplify these themes of how violent pasts and the spaces and objects associated with them become sites of political contestation in the present. The class will then focus particularly on the example of Turkey as a case study through which to approach questions of memory, place, and histories of state violence against minority groups. We will examine in depth the case of the violent transformation of the Ottoman Empire into the contemporary Republic of Turkey with a focus on the 1915 Genocide of Ottoman Armenians and the ongoing war between the Turkish state and the Kurdish minority, in the context of a long history of state violence against minority communities. Throughout the course students will engage with various and competing narratives of histories of violence, including state denial, memories of survivors, and attempts to resurrect the memories of repressed events. Students will engage with theoretical debates relating to memory, state violence, materiality, and space and place, and will design an individual research project relating to the themes of the course.",

Together, we will explore several interrelated questions: (1) How have \"Spain\" and \"Europe\" variously been defined as modern, white, Christian, or secular by figuring Jews and Muslims as others? (2) How have these terms and the forms of life and history that they purport to represent changed over time? (3) What are the similarities and differences between the \"Jewish Question\" and the \"Muslim Problem\"? (4) How do Jews and Muslims understand themselves in relation to Spain, Europe, and to each other? At a time when racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and right-wing populist movements are ascendant in Spain and across Europe, we will work collaboratively to not only answer these questions, but to formulate new ones. To do so, we will consult scholarship in anthropology, history, cultural theory, and philosophy as well as on fiction, film, and journalism as resources. Throughout the term, we will be especially attuned to the forms of inclusion and exclusion that have affected Jews and Muslims in Spain, always with an eye toward how such abstractions come to matter in everyday life.",

Together, we will engage texts and materials that push back on normative understandings of belonging, especially through contemporary conversations of race, gender, class, and sexuality. Drawing from the literature of anthropology and queer theory, as well as psychoanalysis, critical race theory, feminist studies, and the broader social sciences, we will question and reenvision themes such as the family, reproduction, friendship, monogamy, community, and home.

The authentic texts and literary sources are accompanied by creative language learning exercises designed to help students to function across different registers and genres. The course integrates the sociolinguistic reality of Arabic diglossia by engaging students into educational material representing both written Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic-MSA) and spoken Egyptian Arabic.",

Kennedy, The Beatles released their self-titled double album, commonly referred to as The White Album. The recording sessions began on May 30, 1968, twenty-eight days after a student strike in France led to sweeping general strikes across the country that now stand as an emblem for a global moment during which left-wing factions prominently espoused their ideals and dissatisfaction with the administrators of power through creative physical and intellectual protest.While the song Why Don't We Do It In The Road represents a flippant contribution to The White Album we will consider the title as having special meaning in examining what was a new sensibility through which, in the case of Paris 1968, the spaces of the city, the roads, and all else public was appropriated, transformed and utilized in proposing new gestures through which popular participation could yield radical social change.The charged era of the 1960s begat the interventionist tendencies of many cultural producers in the 1970s and beyond. In this studio and discussion-based class, we will consider the way in which agitation\u2014central to the production of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia before and after October 1917\u2014is recouped as a strategy in public art and affiliated political movements.",

    "ClassOverview": "This slide-lecture course is designed to give both art majors and non-majors an introduction to the myriad forms and concerns of art over the last half century. We will begin in the present, looking first at the impact of globalization on the conditions underlying art's production, exhibition and reception. We will then return to the late 1950s and the center of the international art world at the time, New York, and examine how the traditions of painting and sculpture, and with them the idea of a modernist canon, were increasingly challenged by a range of practices (dispersed geographically and otherwise) that have been loosely labeled as neo-dada, pop, minimalism and conceptual art. The second half of the course will focus on the issues raised by the return to representation in painting, by photography and other technologies of reproduction, and by new genres like video art and installation. Even more recent paradigms will be examined, such as the superceding of images by information, and of art exhibition by communication and media platforming. We will consider some of the different ways that artists handle information and new media and technology, for example how they have appropriated relatively new forms like networks and databases. Along with the social and technological changes associated with globalization and the artistic responses to such changes, we will track shifts in art's relationship to audiences and culture at large, and will question the relevance today of distinctions between high and low, margin and mainstream. This will finally equip us to update our notions of modernism and postmodernism in the visual arts, and re-evaluate the usefulness of the avant-garde as a model and re-examine its long-held desire to merge art and life.",

    "ClassOverview": "Paris cemented its reputation as a global center of art in the second half of the nineteenth century. But art-making in Paris did not happen in a vacuum. French artists were active players in the city's numerous crises and transformations between 1848-1900, which included utopian popular revolutions, foreign occupation, and massive urban reconstruction projects. Nineteenth-century Paris was also the capital of an empire that stretched from North and West Africa to the Caribbean and Polynesia. The foreign bodies and objects that filled the city as a result of these imperial circumstances left an indelible mark on French art.This course explores art in Paris at the intersection of modern politics, colonialism, and capitalist industrialization. In addition to avant-garde painting movements such as Impressionism and its \"post-Impressionist\" challengers, we also examine Orientalism and Primitivism alongside academic sculpture, universal exhibitions, and reproductive technologies like photography and the illustrated press. Some of the artists we examine include Gustave Courbet, Honor\u00e9 Daumier, Rosa Bonheur, Nadar, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, \u00c9douard Manet, Gustave Caillebotte, Mary Cassatt, Camille Pissarro, Gustave Moreau, Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me, Henri Matisse, and Paul Gauguin.",

However, twenty six years later, not only has the promissory view of democratic possibility lost its transformative charm, the phrase itself that once encapsulated our cultural futurity has also lost its discursive sway. But in what ways could the envisioned new artistic sensibility captured by phrase, South African cultural expression, help address and practicalise the liberatory as well as conciliatory promises attributed to democracy? What is South Africa? Who are South Africans? This course retrospectively explores the complexities and debates that surround the early 1990s cultural discourses in the unfoldment of democratic dispensation.",

In fact, many of the objects that comprise this canon are oftentimes not \"objects\" at all. Taking a decolonial approach to study the canon of Non-Western art, this course addresses the animacies and ontologies of different categories of \"objects\" in museum collections, including materially-embodied deities such as Katsina dolls (Hopi) and Orishas (Yoruba diaspora); ancestors that take form as seeds (Pueblo) and ceramics (Mimbres), and materials such as feathers (Aztec, Tupinamba, Hawaiian) and pipestone (Lakota, Dakota and Yankton Sioux) that mediate different realms of existence. The class will also consider the remains of humans, plants, and animals housed in anthropology and natural history museums. The question of objecthood also applies to people conceptualized as property, sold as commodities and displayed within ethnographic and World's Fair contexts as well as the land upon which museums are built. We will learn about some of the ways that these \"objects\" entered into museums as we compare the Western epistemologies by which they are organized there to the indigenous ontologies they occupy within their cultures of origin.",

    "ClassOverview": "What do the ostrich egg cup, agate pomander, coral, and other objects laid out on the table in this painting have to do with one another? Their luster, rarity, and highly worked surfaces and combinations of material signal their appeal as unusual things, attractive to early modern European collectors of cabinets of curiosities, also called Kunst- and Wunderkammern. Assembled across Europe from the mid-16th century through to the early 18th century, collections encompassed such varied items as natural specimens, art works, foreign goods, and sometimes musical and scientific instruments. The wide-ranging variety of objects in van Roerstraeten's, Still Life with Ostrich Cup and the Whitfield Heirlooms may seem random to our eyes today but allude to a culture of collecting in which a microcosmic scope was the ideal.This seminar will offer an opportunity to explore the types of objects, practices, and motivations that shaped early modern collections, primarily in northern Europe, through a series of case studies anchored in objects at the Art Institute and will meet primarily at the museum. We will address the roots of early modern Kunst- and Wunderkammer collecting practices, and examine several of the best-preserved records, including treatises, catalogues, and inventories (in modern editions). Objects at the Art Institute will afford first-hand observation and inquiry into the structure and aesthetics of early modern collections in addition to investigation into material and display. We will also examine representations of collections and of the sorts of objects they encompassed as well as the legacy of early modern collections in the origins of public museums. Through discussion and individual research, we will consider how cabinets, the objects and images of the type that would have been collected for cabinets, and their materials were enmeshed in a variety of social and political contexts including networks of collectors, diplomacy, and colonial projects.",

It will critically consider the challenges and  opportunities posed by teaching and exhibiting this material and develop a historical context for current debates about the production and circulation of art that engages with incidents of historical and contemporary racial violence.

This ontological connection between sculpture and (white) marble only strengthened over the course of the eighteenth- and nineteenth centuries, at the same that the discipline of Art History came into fruition. Why does this history associate marble exclusively with whiteness, despite the material's many valuable polychrome varieties? Why does this history treat this whiteness as the absence of color, rather than a color with its own host of political, cultural, and racial associations? What are the sculptural implications for other materials, notably porcelain, sugar, and bronze? This course attempts to answer these questions, among others, by tracing the parallel and interwoven histories of eighteenth-century ideas of racial difference and white marble's rise to prominence within the field of Art History.Students are encouraged to write seminar papers on the political and racial valences of color and materials in art and art historiography across cultural traditions, time periods, and media.",

This course invites students to read and watch South Korean and diasporic narratives centered around disasters, both real and fictional, to engage questions of politics, representation, and inequalities that shape disaster narratives. Ranging from disasters of the past to more contemporary ones such as pandemics and Sewol ferry, the disasters examined in this course have sparked complex conversations surrounding a more just society and the doomed end of the \"normal.\" Engaging scholarship on disasters, speculative fictions, critical race theory, and gender studies, the course introduces students to the varied academic and cultural responses to disasters and the underlying stakes that drive these responses. Students will be assigned a variety of texts to analyze, such as film, novels, webtoons, and news, as well as choosing a disaster narrative of their own interest to examine. No prior knowledge of Korean culture or language are required to take this course. Students are expected to actively participate in class and work in groups on collaborative projects.

At the same moment as former colonial subjects celebrated their liberation, millions of people experienced, and perpetrated, violence and terror on a cataclysmic scale. As the strife of Partition continued to reverberate, the following years saw extremes of idealism, cynicism, invention, and ambition. In this course, we will examine the literature and culture of the decades after 1947, as the namesake children of Salman Rushdie's famous novel grew up in their new postcolonial nations. In addition to reading Rushdie's Midnight's Children, we will spend time with a variety of literary and artistic works, including fiction, poetry, films, plays, and paintings. Secondary works by scholars in a variety of fields will help us get below the surface and to consider a variety of ways to think about democracy, conflict, gender, literary and artistic modernism, and the postcolonial condition, among other themes.",

In the course of this exploration, we seek to challenge our presuppositions about a seemingly simple question: what is \"the body,\" and how do we know? We open by considering themes of dying and the afterlife, food and drink, health and medicine, gender and family. We then turn to Daoist traditions of visual culture that envision the human body as intimately connected with the cosmos and picture the body's interior as a miniature landscape populated by a pantheon of gods. We read ghost stories and analyze the complex history of footbinding. Finally, we conclude with two case studies of religion and the body in contemporary China, one situated on the southwestern periphery, the other in the capital city of Beijing. Throughout the quarter, we investigate how the body has mediated relationships between Buddhist, Daoist, and popular religious traditions. By the course's end, students will gain key resources for understanding historical and contemporary Chinese culture, and new perspectives on what it means to be religious and embodied.",

    "ClassOverview": "AY21-22 When asked in 1985 why he writes \"economic novels\" (keizai sh\u014dsetsu), the popular novelist Kajiyama Toshiyuki responded: \"Why should we limit our literary subjects to love affairs and things like that? There's romance in money: people are living in the much muddier swamp of capitalism.\" By making this \"muddy swamp\" of capitalism legible for a wide range of audiences, the economic novel has become one of the most popular literary genres in postwar Japan. Since their inception in the late 1950s, economic novels have sold as well as, if not better, than mysteries and twice as well as the more high-brow form of \"pure literature\" (jun bungaku). Centering on the economic realities of life under capitalism, economic novels portray the workings of financial corruption, the mechanics of production and distribution, and the experience of laboring within one of the largest consumer economies in the world. This course traces this genre from its origins in 1957 to the contemporary moment. Reading works by early practitioners of the form to its more recent inflections in the literature of writers like Oyamada Hiroko (The Factory), Tsumuro Kikuko (There's No Such Thing as an Easy Job), and Murata Sayaka (Convenience Store Woman), we will examine the relationship between literature and the transformations in Japan's capitalist economy. We will consider, among other topics, how this genre depicts changes in the workplace and forms of labor, systemic modes of economic exploitation, the psychological and emotional experience of debt in a financialized economy, and the gendering of particular types of work. Guiding our inquiry will be an overarching question: what are the connections between literary and economic form?",

    "ClassOverview": "Spring 2022 - This course examines contemporary discussions on the topics of gender, sexuality, and disability in South Korea. The past decade has seen an explosion of popular interest in feminism in South Korea. Along with this were competing debates on social and economic inequalities and legislations, as well as debates on gender identity, everyday experiences of discrimination, and overlooked sites of intersectional violence. From the Gangnam station murder to the #Me Too movement, South Korean cultural industry's rise into the global stage through K-Pop has coincided with intense debates at home and abroad about the experience of gendered citizenship and various forms of marginalization. As the scholar Alison Kafer has poignantly shown, thinking through the entanglements of feminist, queer, and disability concerns is important to rethinking exclusionary claims and their attendant problems. Students will look at some of the major points of debate and events that have ignited the increased interest, engaging literary and popular cultural texts, news articles, and scholarship on feminist, queer, and crip theories. At the same time, these recent debates are not necessarily unique or new. To address such, the course will also consider the broader historical context of militarization, colonialism, and the Korean diaspora that have shaped these debates. No prerequisite knowledge of the Korean language or culture is necessary. As a discussion-based seminar with papers, the course encourages students to hone their critical thinking, speaking, and writing skills.",

Rather than simply introduce the standard canon of Urdu poetry, this course will focus particularly on the vast body of literature that was excluded from the canon. Despite its perennial popularity, many poets and celebrated poems are exluded from that canon today. In addition to exploring that literature, the class will ask how canons are formed, why certain poets, poems, and themes are excluded, and what these excluded works can tell us about Urdu's literary heritage today. The class will have a particular focus on women poets, who have been entirely excluded from the canon but who made major contributions to the literature.

Mindfulness is also being presented as a panacea for those suffering from physical and mental pain, readily available in American hospital settings and psychological counseling services. Buddha images too can be found far from Buddhist temples\u2014at the hip restaurant Buddha-Bar located in many cities around the world one can sip cocktails and dine before a massive Buddha statue while listening to lounge music. And in the Chicago area, one encounters Buddha head sculptures positioned on the ground in parks, by roads, and even in public school playgrounds as part of the Ten Thousand Ripples art project. How, and why, did aspects of Buddhism enter all of these different social locations? Why does Buddhism receive a pass more often than other religions by the \"spiritual but not religious\" crowd? Can Buddhism be secular? In what ways is Buddhism compatible with science, and can Buddhist practices be proven effective using scientific methods? Can paying better attention by means of Buddhist meditation practices liberate us from suffering caused by digital distraction? In what ways can Buddhist articulations of interdependence, no self, and compassion be resources for addressing racial and structural injustice, even as sexual abuse, racism, and trans/homophobia continue to traumatize members of some Buddhist communities?

    "ClassOverview": "*INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*The instructor of \"Lessons in Non-Profit Management\" is: Paul Sznewajs (w/ co-teacher Mary Elizabeth Cole Graettinger)This course is jointly sponsored by Business Institutions and a student organization called campusCatalyst.  The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector.  The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements.  Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector.  To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management.  Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.  The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.  The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.  This course is an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, learn and apply a new set of skills and knowledge while impacting the community.",

During the quarter, we will examine ethical decision-making from a number of perspectives:Your responsibility as a subordinate (which you will be upon graduation and entering the workforce).Your responsibility as a leader (which you will be in short order, given the talent you have already demonstrated).The problem with just solving problems.The bystander problem (see something, say something).We will use real world, contemporary events as the backdrop of our discussions. We will host speakers (in-person and via Skype) who will share their experiences with ethical dilemmas.  We will examine ethical failures that place the lives and limbs of consumers at risk as well as ethical failures that lead to the defrauding of consumers. We will examine the direct impact on all involved-the decision makers, the decision implementors, customers, and society. We will examine truth, facts and lying to determine whether and how much what you say and how you say it matters; the extent to which spin and messaging are acceptable to protect the entity.By the end of this course, you will have defined your own personal code of conduct and developed a plan of action to stick to it when the stakes feel high and you are pressured to abandon it.",

It was often argued that people of different races and different genders were fundamentally different, and as such their roles in society should differ as well. Today, many people reject the claim that race and gender have substantial effect on a person's abilities or capacity, but how did we get here? More importantly, how did science help facilitate these claims in the first place?In this course, we will explore the role of science in historical oppression based on race and gender. We will identify key scientific studies and their subsequent legacy to reveal the precarious nature of scientific interpretation in the hands of biased individuals. We will discuss how power structures can infiltrate scientific integrity and propose safeguards to prevent this kind of infiltration in the future.",

As there will be carryover of topics from one quarter to the next, the 3 quarters of the course must be taken in the designated sequence. As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year. Any deviation from this will require permission of the instructors.The full 3 quarters of this course will cover advanced topics in methods of:Instrumental analysis;Synthesis of inorganic compounds;Synthesis of organic compounds;Spectroscopy.The course is designed for you to work in a \"research environment\". That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion. This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results. For example: In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis. You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses.CHEMISTRY 350-3: The 3rd course in this sequence covers the very important topic of spectroscopy from a physical chemistry point of view. It deals with the use of various spectroscopic techniques (FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, uv/visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy) for structure determination of gas and liquid phase molecules and for kinetics measurements. In addition, you will be asked to design and carry out a 4-week research project at the end of the quarter based on some aspect of course material in the entire Chem 350-1,2,3 sequence.",

How does world literature respond to problems that face the world at large (e.g., global pandemics, world wars, and climate change, etc.)? How appropriate is the term \"world literature\" as a descriptor of planetary literary production and circulation? What are the best methods of reading world literature today? We will try to answer some of these questions and others that arise during class and one-on-one meetings.Discussing and writing about a variety of theories of world literature, we will assess the merits of different approaches (e.g., distant reading, close reading etc.) in the encounter with specific texts from various parts of the planet. Furthermore, we will study how a local text is affected by worldwide movements and how it affects other texts, such that it is best be understood comparatively on a planetary scale.

This course invites students to read and watch South Korean and diasporic narratives centered around disasters, both real and fictional, to engage questions of politics, representation, and inequalities that shape disaster narratives. Ranging from disasters of the past to more contemporary ones such as pandemics and Sewol ferry, the disasters examined in this course have sparked complex conversations surrounding a more just society and the doomed end of the \"normal.\" Engaging scholarship on disasters, speculative fictions, critical race theory, and gender studies, the course introduces students to the varied academic and cultural responses to disasters and the underlying stakes that drive these responses. Students will be assigned a variety of texts to analyze, such as film, novels, webtoons, and news, as well as choosing a disaster narrative of their own interest to examine.

    "ClassOverview": "Jesus is certainly a central figure for Christianity and usually thoughtto mark decisive differences between the religions: the idea of anembodied God is as alien to Judaism as the concept of trinity or thebelief in a substitutionary sacrificial death. Considering this, it seemsvery remarkable that at a closer look, figurations of Jesus abound inJewish literature. In the seminar we will concentrate on the realm ofGerman language texts from the 18th century to the present dealingwith Jesus or related symbols like the cross or scenes of the Passionand Crucifixion. Not surprisingly, in Christian as well as Jewishcontexts mixing religious symbolism in literature and art repeatedlyprovoked scandals. Authors like Carl Einstein were fined forblaspheming Christ, while others like Stefan Zweig, Alfred D\u2000blin orFranz Werfel were accused of having betrayed Judaism.One hypothesis concerning this corpus of texts is that by adoptingcentral narratives and images of the Christian majority society theyclaim Jewish participation and explore its limits. By focusing onJesus as a Jew many of these texts rewrite and transform dominantChristian perspectives and expose their inherent violence. If theypresent the martyred Jesus explicitly as a Jew e.g., connections topersecutions, pogroms and genocide are evoked. At the same time,questions concerning a shared history and modes of respect despitedifference are raised. We will discuss how texts problematizeassimilation and also try to understand the role of (trans-)figurationsof Jesus in 20th Jewish literature about war, the Shoah and themodes of memory.",

    "ClassOverview": "When asked in 1985 why he writes \"economic novels\" (keizai sh\u014dsetsu), the popular novelist Kajiyama Toshiyuki responded: \"Why should we limit our literary subjects to love affairs and things like that? There's romance in money: people are living in the much muddier swamp of capitalism.\" By making this \"muddy swamp\" of capitalism legible for a wide range of audiences, the economic novel has become one of the most popular literary genres in postwar Japan. Since their inception in the late 1950s, economic novels have sold as well as, if not better, than mysteries and twice as well as the more high-brow form of \"pure literature\" (jun bungaku). Centering on the economic realities of life under capitalism, economic novels portray the workings of financial corruption, the mechanics of production and distribution, and the experience of laboring within one of the largest consumer economies in the world. This course traces this genre from its origins in 1957 to the contemporary moment. Reading works by early practitioners of the form to its more recent inflections in the literature of writers like Oyamada Hiroko (The Factory), Tsumuro Kikuko (There's No Such Thing as an Easy Job), and Murata Sayaka (Convenience Store Woman), we will examine the relationship between literature and the transformations in Japan's capitalist economy. We will consider, among other topics, how this genre depicts changes in the workplace and forms of labor, systemic modes of economic exploitation, the psychological and emotional experience of debt in a financialized economy, and the gendering of particular types of work. Guiding our inquiry will be an overarching question: what are the connections between literary and economic form?",

    "ClassOverview": "This course will introduce students to a poorly understood art form that has been reborn many times, including today in the light of pandemic restrictions on theatrical production just recently: audio drama. In the middle decades of the 20th century, radio plays were among the most popular forms of fiction in many parts of the world. Legends have come down about thrillers of the 1930s, but these remain framed inside narratives of nostalgia, and are not representative of the broad work of experimental writers in the medium. In this class, you will learn how radio dramas were made in three historical periods: classic American (1937-54); mid-century British (1954-1974) and contemporary podcast traditions, with additional focus on audio dramas in the global south, including South Africa and India. We will explore the cultural and political background of each of these contexts, practice how to \"read\" a radio play, and ask about how the form interacts with various media, and expressive agendas.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course examines contemporary discussions on the topics of gender, sexuality, and disability in South Korea. The past decade has seen an explosion of popular interest in feminism in South Korea. Along with this were competing debates on social and economic inequalities and legislations, as well as debates on gender identity, everyday experiences of discrimination, and overlooked sites of intersectional violence. From the Gangnam station murder to the #Me Too movement, South Korean cultural industry's rise into the global stage through K-Pop has coincided with intense debates at home and abroad about the experience of gendered citizenship and various forms of marginalization. As the scholar Alison Kafer has poignantly shown, thinking through the entanglements of feminist, queer, and disability concerns is important to rethinking exclusionary claims and their attendant problems. Students will look at some of the major points of debate and events that have ignited the increased interest, engaging literary and popular cultural texts, news articles, and scholarship on feminist, queer, and crip theories. At the same time, these recent debates are not necessarily unique or new. To address such, the course will also consider the broader historical context of militarization, colonialism, and the Korean diaspora that have shaped these debates. No prerequisite knowledge of the Korean language or culture is necessary. As a discussion-based seminar with papers, the course encourages students to hone their critical thinking, speaking, and writing skills.",

To complicate things further, all of these beings are in constant movement, often revealing themselves to be different from what they initially were taken to be. But what they all have in common is a very special and difficult-to-define relationship to the narrative in and through which they appear. This course seeks to focus specifically on the relation between the narrative and the \"animals\" and quasi-animals that are often its subject. Ultimately it seeks to pose the question of the role of the reader and of reading in relating to what seems both irreducibly strange and yet uncannily familiar - what we call \"animals\".",

The shtetl is the central locus and focus of Modern Yiddish Literature; Fiddler on the Roof itself was based on a Sholem Aleichem story.  In this seminar we shall explore the spectrum of representations of the shtetl in Yiddish literature from the nineteenth century to the post-Holocaust period.  We shall also focus on artistic and photographic depictions of the shtetl: Chagall and Roman Vishniac in particular.

We focus on the ways the images and metaphors have been used as carriers of cultural value and ideological meaning, exploring such issues as word and image, gender and nationality, aesthetics and psychology, politics and propaganda. Since the course topic involves such disciplines as visual art, literature, cultural theory, and philosophy, readings include modern and contemporary aesthetic theories (Shklovsky, Gyorgy Lukacs, Boris Groys) and twentieth-century political and ethical philosophy (Gramsci, Ortega-i-Gasset, Walter Benjamin et al.), and psychology (Freud, Edward Bernays).",

    "ClassOverview": "The Politics of Seduction and Consent: Literature, Psychoanalysis and PhilosophyIn the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp, what is left of seduction?  As its etymological derivation from the Latin seducere makes evident, seduction signifies the threat of being led astray, suggesting a problematic reorganization of boundaries, activity and passivity, power, and vulnerability.  How have literature, psychoanalysis and philosophy responded to the drama of dissymmetry and otherness?  To what extent does seduction affirm an inequitable logic when it comes to age, gender, and race?  Does seduction always imply violence?  How can we define the notion of consent, and can it offer not only legal redress but ethical care?  To what extent can justice regulate sex, fantasies, and desires?  To what extent has psychoanalysis problematically altered our notions of guilt and innocence when it comes to seduction?  Throughout this seminar, we aim to confront these questions by revisiting primal scenes of seduction and consent in a broad range of literary, psychoanalytical, legal, and philosophical texts from Europe and the USA. Works covered will include texts by Springora, Kouchner, Nabokov, Freud, Ferenczi, Laplanche, Srinivasan, Hartman, Butler, Nussbaum, Alcoff, Kukla, and Dougherty.",

We will critically compare and appraise the different  methodologies, aims, concepts of power, and interpretive politics within these analyses of sexuality and/or the family  as contingent formations. We will  give attention to several recent publications  by the philosophers under consideration that  have  prompted contemporary revision of established interpretations of these bodies of work. And we will ask how the work of Beauvoir, Fanon, Foucault and Castro-G\u00f3mez continues to be resituated today within  a number of fields including  contemporary critical theory, decolonial theory, critical race studies,  and gender and sexualities studies. We will ask: what new concepts have now emerged from these transits and translations of mid twentieth-century theory?",

Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services?

First, profit-seeking firms may try to reduce competition through price discrimination, resale price maintenance, entry deterrence, predation, horizontal mergers, vertical integration, or collusion. We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, cable television, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of winner-take-all markets, in which bandwagon effects result in convergence to a single operating system, recording technology, or social network. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate. We will analyze the ideal scope of artificial monopoly rights and the natural tension between intellectual property and antitrust law.

We will study the problems of cities, urban areas, and regions by examining the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance.

Our exploration will be done in the context of theories of justice. But the literature offers elaborations of theories of justice, both within legal frameworks and beyond, as they shape communities and the private lives of people. We will ask how religious ideas of justice inform and depart from secular ideas of justice, how retributive and distributive ideas of justice are imagined and critiqued, and how the relation between justice and law has been conceived.",

Ranging over a wide variety of texts\u2014from Thomas Hobbes to Calvin & Hobbes, scathing satire of British imperialism to memes of Bernie in mittens, comic poems to comic strips\u2014we will develop tools to analyze the aesthetic and political import of jokes and laughter. Drawing a long arc from the seventeenth century through the present day will allow us to appreciate, in rich historical context, the forms and social effects (not to mention the wit itself) of the texts we examine. Readings include Hobbes's Leviathan, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal, poems by Dorothy Parker, performances by Reggie Watts, and Alison Bechdel's Dykes to Watch Out For. We will also analyze excerpts and episodes of contemporary comic media, including Atlanta, The Good Place, and What We Do in the Shadows.",

    "ClassOverview": ": Ill women are scattered across the pages of literature, from swooning ladies in sentimental novels to cancer patients in popular fiction. Illness acts as narrative momentum, as a metaphor for social \"ills,\" and as a signifier of tragic virtue in an individual character. Focusing on the 18th and 19th centuries, this class will examine how the tropes of illness in popular literature pertains to our broader cultural assumptions about illness, health, and gender. How do traits associated with femininity resemble literary representations of illness, and vice-versa? How might we locate or analyze femininity in representations of ill men? How do these tropes change over time? What happens if health, rather than illness, becomes a primary marker of virtue? And what does all of this mean for us today? How has the construction of ill femininity been bound up in whiteness, and how has this contributed to systemic and medical racism? What is the relationship between the representation of ill femininity and contemporary \"wellness culture\"\u2014or even contemporary feminism?",

    "ClassOverview": "What is it about our own period that necessitates '90s nostalgia, and how does this require remembering the '90s in a certain way? Is there a mood, feeling, or affect readily identifiable as \"The '90s,\" and what social transformations does this mood express? In the 1990s, Francis Fukuyama announced the end of history, Britney Spears, the Princess of Pop, sang \"my loneliness is killing me,\" and the MTV generation emerged as a self-styled generation of slackers. Even as Toni Morrison won the Nobel Prize and the Whitney Biennial became the most diverse exhibit by a major American museum, Operation Gatekeeper militarized the US-Mexico border and the Los Angeles riots brought widespread attention to anti-Black violence. This course will read deeply and diversely across the period, with an emphasis on African American, Asian American, and Latinx literature, in order to grapple with the contradictions between ostensible cultural tolerance, the explosion of consumerism, and the persistence of structural and economic inequality. Working together, we will produce our own account of recent history, as it affects us. We will ask: What does it mean to say that a decade feels a certain way? How did narratives about race, class, gender, and nation converge and diverge? Were the '90s just the '70s all over again? Possible authors and primary texts include Clueless, Karen Tei Yamashita, Nirvana, Percival Everett, Paul Beatty, Seinfeld, Pavement, Harryette Mullen, Ernesto Quio\u00f1ez, Slacker, Sex and the City.",

Our phones chronicle our daily experiences and we share them so that friends and strangers around the world consume the details of our lives in real time.In this class, we'll revisit some classic works of American autobiography in order to take stock of the long backstory to our current autobiographical moment.  How have prior generations thought about the possibilities of telling their life stories?  What have been the stakes in doing so?  Who were the imagined readers of these texts, and what happens when they're read in contexts and by people that the original authors could hardly have imagined\u2014including all of us now in the twenty-first century.Our reading will include autobiographical works by Mary Rowlandson, a Puritan woman captured by Native Americans who wrote about her experiences; founding father Benjamin Franklin; Frederick Douglass, the formerly enslaved person turned brilliant abolitionist leader; William Apess, author of the first autobiography by a Native American; and the great gay poet Walt Whitman, who invented a wholly new kind of poetry to tell his story.  In every case we'll be interested in the ways\u2014different from ours\u2014that these authors constructed the stories of their lives, as well as the cultural, political, social, and national contexts within which they lived them.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Someone put their heart and soul into making this.\" \"Created using traditional methods.\" \"Handcrafted by artisans.\" \"One-of-a-kind.\" \"Handmade.\" However it's framed to us, something about processes of making by hand appeals to us. In this writing composition class, we will consider how the handcrafted shapes our relationship with the material world. We will think about how handmade items materialize embodied knowledge practices (like the baker who intuitively knows when the dough just right), how the label \"handmade\" influences our spending habits (aren't we tempted to pay just a little bit more for something that was made by hand?), and how handcrafted objects produce affective attachments (like the items we hold onto because they were made by someone close to us). Handmade objects tell us stories about who made them and, often, these stories influence how we perceive and value these objects. Moreover, practices of making by hand have a long history. How have our relationships to handmade objects and labor changed since the rise of mass manufacturing? What does the popularity of DIY projects say about our connection to making by hand? What are the ethical stakes of fetishizing the handcrafted? These are some of the questions we will investigate through a variety of genres, including novels, essays, articles, and poetry. Writing, too, is a craft. As we read these texts, we will consider the style, organization, and argumentation strategies of different writers, evaluating the effectiveness of these approaches through revision-based writing assignments. We will also hone critical reading and research skills, culminating in a research project on a topic that interests you related to processes of making by hand.",

    "ClassOverview": "We live in a time when hostility toward immigrants has made many Americans forget that, as President Obama said, \"We are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too.\" This hostility has obscured the complex reality of the lives of immigrants.  In this course, we will study literary works by immigrants and their children in order to understand that complex reality. We will read novels and short stories written over the last 25 years that tell stories of immigrants from Ethiopia, India, Mexico, and Vietnam. We will explore such questions as: How do social attitudes and institutions impact the lives of immigrants as they seek to pursue the \"American Dream\"?  What happens to the relationships between parents and children through the process of acculturation into American society?  How do differences in national origin connect with other differences, particularly gender, race, ethnicity, and class? What are the similarities and differences between the experiences of immigrants and those of refugees?",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar will explore language as part of our social experience. We will examine the spoken and written language we use and observe in a variety of everyday situations, considering such questions as: Why do we call some language varieties \"dialects\" and others \"languages?\" Why do some people think you have an accent while others think you don't? Has your own language changed since you came to Northwestern? What patterns govern the conversations we have, and how do we create social relationships, communities, and identities in those conversations? Why do some people mix multiple languages when they speak and write? Is it, like, ok for me to, like, use like so much? What about um or ain't or ya know? Students will formulate and consider their own questions about language and social life in papers and presentations.",

In lectures and discussion sections, we shall explore the divergent textual voices--white and black, male and female, poor and rich, enslaved and free--that constitute important strands of the literary tradition of the United States in the nineteenth century. Central to our study will be the following questions: What does it mean to be an American in 1850, 1860, 1865, and beyond? Who speaks for the nation? How do the tragedy and the triumph of the Civil War inflect American poetry and narrative? And how do post-bellum writers represent the complexities of democracy, particularly the gains and losses of Reconstruction, the advent of and resistance to the \"New Woman,\" and the class struggle in the newly reunited nation?",

    "ClassOverview": "What does it mean to be possessed by a divine or demonic spirit, another person, or the past?  In this course, we will explore possession as a nexus for crucial questions that literature stages regarding autonomy and ownership, gender and sexuality, and national and personal identity.  Beginning with classical mythology and the divine frenzy that Plato writes possesses good poets, we will then investigate more threatening spectacles of possession, including William Shakespeare's Macbeth and selections from Aldous Huxley's The Devils of Loudon (1952), the story of a famous reported demonic possession at a French convent.  We will go on to study the possessions and hauntings staged in Edgar Allen Poe's short stories and Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca (1938). The course concludes by studying what it means to be denied self-possession by another person, society, or the legacy of a haunting past in Toni Morrison's Beloved (1987), James Baldwin's essays, and Natasha Trethewey's Native Guard (2008).  These texts invite analysis of the dynamics of possession between the individual and society, lover and beloved, and past and present; each also invites inquiry into how possession informs what it means to read, write, or claim ownership of a narrative.Throughout the course, students will develop analysis and argumentation skills through writing and revising essays on different literary genres.  Students will also learn how we can interpret texts in conjunction with major schools of thought in literary criticism and theory.",

What do human representations of polar spaces tell us\u2014south of the Arctic and north of the Antarctic\u2014about our relationship to space, environment, and climate? In this course, we will explore the most prominent of Polar genres, the travel narrative, to better understand how these places shape, and are shaped by, our political, aesthetic, and ethical understanding. Examining the sublime appeal of icy solitude figured in Romantic poetry and modern science fiction, working with archival materials of failed Victorian expeditions, and reading Inuit novels memorializing ways of life threatened by outside intrusions, we will consider the power of various narrative mediums and technologies to cultivate care for the distant, the invisible, and the potentially catastrophic. By investigating how our cultural conceptions of ice have evolved over time, we will come to appreciate how narrative is turned to, time and again, to render the far away nearby, as well as learn how we might more effectively take up narrative now as these climes face crisis.",

    "ClassOverview": "Have you noticed that, unlike many other languages, English often has two different names for the same animal? These double names can be traced back to 1066, when the French-speaking Normans, led by William the Bastard, conquered England and installed their countrymen in positions of power. In the aftermath of this victory, William the Bastard became William the Conqueror and cows and pigs and sheep became beef and pork and mutton - at least when they were served up to the Normans at their banquets. Like many other words associated with aristocratic life, these terms all derive from French. In this course we will investigate this and many other milestones in the history of the English language, focusing on the period from the early middle ages through the eighteenth century. We will pay particular attention to the relationships among \"high\" and \"low\" forms of language, including efforts to elevate the status of English and the dynamics of self-consciously \"low\" registers of language such as slang and obscenity.

And sometimes we write about our obsession directly, hoping (perhaps futilely) to be purged free of it, once and for all. Susan Sontag, while talking about writing and the writer's life, said it simply: \"You have to be obsessed. It's not something you'd want to be\u2014it's rather something you couldn't help but be.\" In this course we'll explore \"obsession\" from two main angles: personally and textually. On the personal level, and as a way to get us started, we'll discuss and identify subjects we keep returning to\u2014from harmless infatuations to downright obsessions. Is Kendrick Lamar, Lizzo or the soundtrack from Mama Mia playing nonstop on your headphones, for example? Is there a painting you keep seeing in your mind's eye? What exactly is your relationship with a well-made cheeseburger? What is the chronic conflict of your life? On a textual level, we'll read stories, essays, and books that deal with obsession in one form or another, or reveal the linguistic obsessions the author held while writing them.Students will have the option to write a creative non-fiction essay or a short story.

Over the course of the quarter, we will explore the ways in which Chaucer experiments with late medieval literary genres, from chivalric romances to bawdy fabliaux, frustrating and playing upon the expectations of his audience.   Against and alongside this literary context, we will consider the dramatic context of the pilgrimage itself, asking questions about how the character of an individual pilgrim, or the interaction between pilgrims, further shapes our perceptions and expectations of the tales:  How is a romance different, for example, when it is told by a knight, by a social climber, or by a renegade wife?

These plays will help us think about theatrical genres, about the conditions of writing, performance, and printing, about modes of social organization (marriage, family, sexuality, reproduction, social class, race and ethnicity, monarchy, dynasty, nation, to name a few), about periodization (\"Renaissance\" or \"early modern\"?), and about canonicity (for example, the distinction between Shakespeare and \"his contemporaries\" implied by our curriculum and in the first sentence of this course description).",

    "ClassOverview": "The birth of the Gothic novel, a genre overflowing with ruined castles, misty wastelands, and sinister forests, coincided with the Industrial Revolution\u2014an unprecedented shift in human interactions with the environment. This course will consider the development of the Gothic genre in the eighteenth century and Romantic period as a revealing glimpse into the period's anxieties regarding humankind's place in the natural world, largely by way of the supernatural forces writers conjured to make sense of their fears of the changing landscape. In turn, we will consider how Gothic tropes\u2014including the monstrous, the uncanny, and the sublime\u2014shape current ecological discourses around the Anthropocene and climate catastrophe. By reading some of the genre's most (in)famous writers, including Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Lewis, Mary Shelley, and Emily Bronte, we will examine how the Gothic affords a distinctly ecological perspective on questions of sexuality, nationality, xenophobia, and otherness in Britain and America--then and now--as well as a means for capturing the changing, and often uncanny, relationships between the human, the non-human, and the more-than-human.",

Bront\u00eb's iconic Gothic tale of \"madness,\" and that concept's inflection by gender, race, and nationality, has become central to our ideas about difference. Tracing the afterlives of Bront\u00eb's confined madwoman through twentieth-century reimaginations of the trope, including Shirley Jackson's Haunting of Hill House, Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea, and recent films such as Midsommar and Hereditary, this course will examine how insanity has been seen as a category useful for regaining (and sometimes blocking) political and literary agency. Putting these texts and films in dialogue with critical responses by Michel Foucault, Gayatri Spivak, and others, we will explore the knotty question of how madness shapes our culture's narratives about gender and authority.",

We will also consider a range of sources from the music videos of Janelle Mon\u00e1e to the poetry of June Jordan and Audre Lorde, among other texts to develop and elaborate our own theories of black joy.Some conceptual questions for consideration include the following: how do theories of the body inflect notions of black joy? What is the relationship between pleasure and pain in contemporary black life and how do scholars relate this dialectic to the world beyond the body? To what extent does black happiness align with or destabilize prevailing theories of happiness in scholarly fields including affect theory and literary and cultural studies?",

    "ClassOverview": "This class will examine lesbian representation in film and television over the last four decades. \"Representation\" is a tricky word in politics and media: queer communities, communities of color, and disabled communities (and those categories overlap in important ways) have pushed for more representation in film, television, the music industry, and publishing. Lesbian women have long complained of the community's invisibility. At the same time, minoritized communities must grapple with the fact that simple representation can be a mixed bag. If the primary goal is visibility, is all representation good representation? Are lesbian villains, or lesbians who are narratively punished, still politically useful?  Does the inclusion of a lesbian character (or lesbian characters) \"count\" if no one involved in the production of the object was themselves a lesbian? This course will explore these questions and more, discussing theoretical readings from cultural studies alongside our primary films, television, music, and print media. We will consider the difficult and derogatory tropes that are part and parcel of lesbian representation in the media, but we will engage most intensively with narratives that have attempted to expand the narrative potential of queer female life and to affirm lesbian identities\u2014with complex results.",

It grounds the discussion in a longer history of colonial extraction and Indigenous dispossession, racism, structural neglect, and ongoing residential segregation by discussing Zora Neale Hurston's 1937 hurricane novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, and looking at Zitkala-\u0160a's influential 1924 report on the settler defrauding of Osage Indians for their oil-rich lands.",

The image of a strong female lead shooting arrows, jumping off trains, and generally kicking ass, has captured the attention of readers and movie-goers, even as superhero film franchises have been slow to feature female leads. This class asks why strong heroines are popular in this cultural moment both by analyzing the novels and films that feature them, and by contextualizing them through the lens of cultural studies. We will dissect characterizations of recent popular heroines and examine how they might undermine hierarchies and norms of gender and sexuality. At the same time, our inquiry will trouble whether the current era of heroines is as subversive as it might seem. Has the recent popularity of action heroines changed the way popular culture represents the role of women and girls in society more generally? Is the heroine's journey distinct from the hero's? How might the heroine destabilize constructs of gender and sexuality? How does the role of the heroine relate to literary or movie genres? To answer these questions, our readings will engage with queer and feminist theory, masculinity studies, and film theory.",

We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing.

In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning.

What inspires poets' \"making\"? What makes a poem \"new\"? And what roles does translation play in generating new poems and poetics as the twentieth century \"turns a new page in the book of the world\" and opens \"a startling chapter\" of \"world-embracing cultures\" and \"hitherto undreamed responsibilities for nations and races\" (Fenollosa)? These questions open broad reaches on the vast river of poetic traditions, materials, techniques, and experiences that poets navigated during the long, turbulent twentieth century, articulating poetic aims, theories, principles, and manifestos as they went. Baudelaire sings the painter of modern life; Yeats borrows from French Symbolism to launch the Celtic Revival; Eliot urges poets to cultivate a historical sense so as to discern what's new in their own moment; for William Carlos Williams, \"So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens.\" We'll begin by studying highlights of this thrillingly generative moment in literary history to see how poems emerge in creative dialogue with other poems within and across historical moments, locales, languages, cultural surrounds, and sensibilities. We'll hone close reading, analytic, and comparative skills as we deepen our knowledge of the historical conditions that helped to shape the imaginative, formal, and linguistic virtuosity of poems-as-worlds and to enrich the resources of English poetry, from verse lines, forms, sound patterns (meter, rhythm, music, tone), diction, and figurative language to the poets' situations, voices, addressees, and audiences. In the final weeks, working with our Humanities Bibliographer and me, students will home in on topics and design juicy, imaginative, feasible projects that combine scholarly research and literary interpretation. One for all and all for one, we'll learn to frame promising research questions; to navigate scholarly databases and archives; to gather and evaluate sources and think in dialogue with them; and to give and take constructive critique in crafting a sound, engaging, well-written essay.",

The poem poses numerous interpretative puzzles\u2014the objects of the poem's irony, the politics of its author, and the demographics of its intended audience, to name a few\u2014puzzles that have been \"solved\" in strikingly different ways at different historical moments. This course takes as its subject the Canterbury Tales and its reception history, exploring in detail both the poem and its multiple interpretative contexts. As we read the Tales, we will consider the narratives (and narrative conventions) that Chaucer transforms and the fourteenth-century voices with whom he is in dialogue. We will investigate the ways in which the tales circulated both individually and as a collection and analyze the various paratexts that accompanied them (glosses, prologues, illustrations, and \"spurious\" links and tales). Along with the early publication context, we will explore current critical conversation in Chaucer Studies (as well as medieval studies more broadly) and the scholarly history to which it responds, reading the Tales through the lens of critical race studies, feminist and queer theory, postcolonial studies, psychoanalysis, and old and new historicisms. In this context, we will use the Tales to ask \"Why Chaucer?,\" taking up some of the recent controversies in medieval literary studies and the responses they have catalyzed.",

    "ClassOverview": "A Tudor idiom frames the now commonplace phrase, \"the body politic.\" What mythographies, theologies, theories, and ideologies built this conception of socio-political organization? While social contract theory would soon reach new predominance (ie with Thomas Hobbes in the 17thC and rising 18thC claims about the foundational role of consent to government), what models preceded it? What claims and values justified the apparent organicism of a faith or reliance on the human body as an allegory for political authority? How do these approaches manage qualities like gender, age, or illness that might trouble the allegory?This seminar will consider some key texts in early English political thought, beginning with the Tudor court case from which the phrase \"the body politic\" is mainly cited, and proceeding then to materials from the unsettling events of the English Reformation that address the question of obedience to the secular power (ie Thomas More's Utopia, William Tyndale's Obedience of a Christian Man, Thomas Cranmer's homilies from the first decade of the English church) and to anatomical and medical materials (like Thomas Elyot's Castel of Helthe and Helkiah Crooke's Microcosmographia). From this groundwork, we will move on consider early modern English debates about royal authority, including the ideological disarray triggered by the historical facts of a female monarch and of rebellion as treason (ie John Knox's First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, selected speeches given by Elizabeth I, James I's The Law of Free Monarchy, and John Milton's Tenure of Kings and Magistrates). To explore these dynamics in the context of theater (then the largest assemblages of people into \"bodies\"), the seminar will delve into several Shakespeare plays (from among Henry IV 1&2, Richard II, Richard III, A Midsummer Night's Dream, King Lear, and most particularly Measure for Measure) to assess the proposition that Shakespeare \u2014 among his other forms of attention \u2014 was also a political theorist.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course is an introduction to Arabic literary production of the long nineteenth century as it engages the \"nah\u1e0da\" (awakening), understood variously as a discourse on modernity, a utopian social project, and an epistemological rupture wrought by colonialism and capitalism. With special emphasis on the genealogies, practices, and problematics of Arabic literary modernity, this course will introduce students to the major works of Arabic literature produced in the nineteenth and early twentieth century and to the major debates, social changes, and material developments that attend the period, including (but not limited to) language reform, migration, print capitalism, imperialism, and nationalism. In short, we will try to understand how these authors, through their texts, both produced and theorized modernity for their readers in the localized contexts of Imperial influence and control on the one hand, and the global-though uneven-nineteenth-century processes of social, political, economic, and technological change.",

Du Bois's proclamation that the \"color line [is] the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea\" as a cue, this graduate seminar examines and engages Afro-Asian critique as a way to interrogate the world-systems of race, caste, and colorism as they are routed through, and inform the political landscapes, of the U.S. and South Asia. By underscoring the limits and possibilities of disciplinarity, the seminar explores the ways the overlapping histories of Blacks and South Asians necessitate new modes of critical analysis, knowledge production, and artistic creation to imagine alternative socialities. As such, course material will cover works ranging from the rhetoric and speeches (of B. R. Ambedkar and Martin Luther King), aesthetic statements on color (Perumal Murugan and Zora Neal Hurston), political manifestos (the Black Panther Party and the Dalit Panthers), as well as art (A/Nil and Casteless Collective).",

We will begin the course and introduce these literary accounts with recordings and written transcripts of selected WPA interviews of former slaves by largely white interlocutors working for the Roosevelt Administration.  By exploring the variety of writing, from travel and slave narrative and to fiction, this course will consider the forms and content produced by Black women during the nineteenth century and raise questions concerning at least: shifting political and social identities, authorship, proto-Black feminism, and the possibilities and limitations of the Black woman \"archive\" versus a \"canon.\"Course materials will include Mary Prince, The Slave Narrative of Mary Prince: A West Indian Slave (1831); Hannah Crafts, The Bondswoman's Narrative (n.d. 1850s); Harriet Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861); Julia Collins, The Curse of Caste; or, The Slave Bride (1865); Elizabeth Keckley, Behind the Scenes; 30 Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House (1868); Alice Dunbar Nelson, Confessions of a Lazy Woman (~1903); Pauline Hopkins, Of One Blood (1902-1903); and Zora Neale Hurston, Barracoon: The Story of the Last \"Black Cargo\" (unpub. 1927/2018).

We will workshop poems as discrete objects and part of a group, considering how the organization of poems can generate new possibilities for thematic, narrative, and affective meaning.

Environmental anthropology became more prominent in the 1980s, and is typically characterized by research on communities' engagements with contemporary environmental issues.  Environmental anthropology has greater commitments to advocacy, critique, and application than ecological anthropology, but as we'll see in this course, the proliferation of \"new ecologies\" (as opposed to \"new environmentalisms\") denotes the continued synergy between ecological and environmental anthropologies.This course is divided into two parts.  Part I will provide an historical overview of the development of environmental anthropology.  We will cover some of the most influential research trends in the field: environmental determinism, cultural ecology, systems ecology, ethnoecology, historical ecology, political ecology, and post-humanist ecology.  Part II will then pivot to the application of environmental anthropology knowledge to some of the most pressing environmental issues facing the contemporary world: population pressure, capitalist consumption patterns, biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture, climate change, and environmental justice.",

Analyzing a variety of works of media addressing environmental themes, including works drawn from advertising and marketing, we will consider different types of environmental messaging and attempts to mobilize public moral engagement. Specifically, we will be looking at strategies for implementing media interventions as moral interventions. Discussion taken up in this class will include evaluating the comparative value of media messaging that emphasizes individual action and personal responsibility, versus messaging that promotes collective action, policy, and structural changes. Students will consider and debate what constitutes authentic \"green\" messaging versus mere corporate \"greenwashing.\" Throughout, we will ask what kind of media we need in what has been called the \"Anthropocene\" (a time when humans are now a major geologic force affecting the future of the planet). When motivating public moral engagement in climate crisis, are the solutions being offered those that the planet will actually \"register\" or \"notice\" on a global scale? If not, what kinds of \"media interventions\" do we need to be making and how? Course content will include discussion of media interventions as moral interventions, media activism for social change, eco-media responses by religious communities and organizations, participatory digital culture, and the challenges of addressing environmental crisis in the distraction economy and what has been called the \"post-truth era.\" Students will have the opportunity to learn by doing, proposing and crafting their own environmental media interventions as the course's final project.

    "ClassOverview": "\"Water in Arid Lands: Israel and the Middle East\"This seminar will explore how the availability of water has shaped the development of civilizations and driven innovation in water technologies. The course will investigate historical dimensions of water in Israel and the Middle East, focusing on ancient civilizations and the water infrastructures that are essential tools in aiding the development of water-poor societies. We will use this historical context as a stepping-stone to transition into a more recent history of the Middle East, focusing on the challenges that the nascent state of Israel faced following the influx of millions of immigrants. We will then examine efforts to develop the necessary water resources needed to support the burgeoning population as well as the irrigation projects designed to convert barren desert land into cultivated agriculture. This more recent history will help to set the stage for discussions regarding geopolitical conflicts over land and water that continue to this day. We will evaluate regional climate and water in the context of current and future geopolitical conflicts, reviewing recent advances in water technologies spurred by these limitations as well as the potential development of combined social and technological solutions for long-term water sustainability in Israel and the Middle East. We will end the course with discussions regarding opportunities for global translation of innovative water technologies and water-management solutions developed in Israel to other water-poor regions. In addition, the course will host a one-day conference featuring international experts. It will explore how water access and control contributes to trans-boundary politics and how recent advances in Israeli water technologies may serve as a model for sustainable water development in other water-poor regions of the world.This course is taught with CIV_ENV 395-0-25 and JWSH_ST 390-0-1",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Environmental Justice in Black & Indigenous Women's Literature\"While ecocriticism has not always considered the lived experience of women of color, literary texts by African American and Native American women have found ways of theorizing their own versions of environmental and spatial justice. Reading leading theorists like Rob Nixon and Edward Soja side by side with Jesmyn Ward's post-Katrina novel Salvage the Bones (2011), Toni Jensen's stories about oil and fracking on Indigenous lands, and poetry by Nikky Finney and Heid E. Erdrich, this class interrogates how literature can inform our understanding of environmental injustice and different types of violence. It grounds the discussion in a longer history of colonial extraction and Indigenous dispossession, racism, structural neglect, and ongoing residential segregation by discussing Zora Neale Hurston's 1937 hurricane novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, and looking at Zitkala-\u0160a's influential 1924 report on the settler defrauding of Osage Indians for their oil-rich lands.This course is taught with ENGLISH 378-0-21",

    "ClassOverview": "\"The Chicago Way\": Urban Spaces and American LiteratureUrbanologist Yi Fu Tuan writes, \"What begins as undifferentiated space becomes place when we get to know it better and endow it with values.\" In The Untouchables, Sean Connery tells Kevin Costner, \"You want to get Capone? Here's how you get Capone. He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue. That's the Chicago way.\" In this class, we will examine \"the Chicago way\" from many different angles in order to interrogate the values with which various artists have endowed Chicago. We will read in a broad range of media: journalism, poetry, song, fiction, film, and sequential art to see how a sense of Chicago as a place works over time. We will pay close attention to depictions of the construction of American identity, and to the role of the artist and intellectual in the city.This course is taught with ENGLISH 378-0-22 and AMER_ST 310-0-10",

While discussing various theoretical statements, we will assess the place of the non-human in the African thought. We will discuss work by well-known authors (e.g., Wole Soyinka, Bessie Head, J.M. Coetzee, Abulrazak Gurnah, and Ngugi wa Thiong'o), fiction and poetry by important but neglected authors (e.g., Saida Hagi-Dirie Herzi and Henry ole Kulet), and works by emergent writers who deploy animality as a trope to explore the relationship between the human and the non-human.  Subtopics will include ecology, biopolitics, slavery, race, diaspora, intra-African immigration, science fiction, queerness, and ubuntu.

Whose world ends in \"end of the world\" narratives? This course invites students to read and watch South Korean and diasporic narratives centered around disasters, both real and fictional, to engage questions of politics, representation, and inequalities that shape disaster narratives. Ranging from disasters of the past to more contemporary ones such as pandemics and Sewol ferry, the disasters examined in this course have sparked complex conversations surrounding a more just society and the doomed end of the \"normal.\"   Engaging scholarship on disasters, speculative fictions, critical race theory, and gender studies, the course introduces students to the varied academic and cultural responses to disasters and the underlying stakes that drive these responses. Students will be assigned a variety of texts to analyze, such as film, novels, webtoons, and news, as well as choosing a disaster narrative of their own interest to examine. No prior knowledge of Korean culture or language are required to take this course. Students are expected to actively participate in class and work in groups on collaborative projects. Assignments will consist of short essays and a creative final project.This course is taught with ASIAN_LC 240-0-20 and COMP_LIT 202-0-20",

The Mediterranean is traversed by different cultures; it is the world of seafarers, travelers, and migrants. Marseille, France's second city, is one of the major ports of the Mediterranean. In contrast to the South of France of Nice or Cannes, the \"wicked city\" has been a melting pot of cultures in the global south, attracting workers from throughout France's former colonies, notably Algeria. Covering the period from the Second World War to the beginning of the twenty-first century, we will address issues of justice and social upheavals in relation to France's colonial past and the \"banlieue\", migration from the perspective of the francophone black diaspora, and forms of belonging beyond the nation-state.",

    "ClassOverview": "How did France become a secular republic whereas it began as a divine-right monarchy? What did it take to uproot centuries of tradition, social hierarchy, and the established political order France shared with the rest of Europe? In this course, we examine the role of culture and discourse in the revolutionary process by exploring the symbols, cultural practices, and forms of speech that shaped the most radical socio-political transformation in the history of the Francophone world. The French Revolution drew on a powerful new understanding of \"man\" in order to reinvent or throw out entirely age-old notions of sovereignty, the law, God, religion, the calendar, the nation, and the family. Crucial to the Revolution's contagious force were the texts, iconography, songs, and spectacles that made it the first mass cultural phenomenon in French history. Beginning with the philosophical challenge to absolute monarchy, we will survey the revolution's most significant cultural achievements, including the emergence of a free press, the birth of human rights, secularism and the reinvention of religion, the reconstitution of time, the rise of new forms of theatricality and ritual, and the creation of new symbols. We conclude with a consideration of antislavery revolution in colonial Haiti, which in many ways exceeded the radicalism of the French Revolution. Works by Rousseau, Siey\u00e8s, Marat, De Lisle, Robespierre, Maurin De Pompigny, Dessalines, and others. Taught in French, but readings include essays in English.",

    "ClassOverview": "In the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp, what is left of seduction? As its etymological derivation from the Latin seducere makes evident, seduction signifies the threat of being led astray, suggesting a problematic reorganization of boundaries, activity and passivity, power, and vulnerability. How have literature, psychoanalysis and philosophy responded to the drama of dissymmetry and otherness? To what extent does seduction affirm an inequitable logic when it comes to age, gender, and race? Does seduction always imply violence? How can we define the notion of consent, and can it offer not only legal redress but ethical care? To what extent can justice regulate sex, fantasies, and desires? To what extent has psychoanalysis problematically altered our notions of guilt and innocence when it comes to seduction? Throughout this seminar, we aim to confront these questions by revisiting primal scenes of seduction and consent in a broad range of literary, psychoanalytical, legal, and philosophical texts from Europe and the USA. Works covered will include texts by Springora, Kouchner, Nabokov, Freud, Ferenczi, Laplanche, Srinivasan, Hartman, Butler, Nussbaum, Alcoff, Kukla, and Dougherty.",

Psychoanalysis, phenomenology, cultural anthropology, gender theory, neurosciences, ecocriticism, have all provoked important shifts in the epistemology of the body. They have enriched our understanding and experience of embodiment, while upsetting traditional Western dualisms and partitions, to begin with the nature/culture and the body/mind divides.From the so-called natural body to the trans or cyborgian body, from the speaking body of psychoanalysis to the joyful body of second wave feminism, from biopolitics to body art, from the human organism to the ecology of the living, this course will revisit some chapters in the history of these shifts. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which they have affected gender theory or have been compounded by it, in an attempt to ascertain their stakes for both feminist and postfeminist thought as well as politics.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course introduces students to ideas and concepts of health care and social protection during socialism and post-socialism in Eastern and Southeastern Europe. The course will explore systems based on the principle of \"health for all\" and their transformation during the so-called post-socialist transition from state-planned to market-oriented economies. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, we will examine the complex relationship between socialist heritage and the influence of neoliberal policies on health care systems in former socialist states, with a special emphasis on the former Yugoslavia. Key course topics include: socialist governance and health care policy; the politics of post-socialist \"transition\"; the neoliberalization of health care and social protection policies; patients and their rights in the new order; informal economies and clientelism; and challenges in access to healthcare for marginalized social groups. Additionally, we will discuss the complex relationship between socialist legacy and neoliberal transformation regarding the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the former socialist states. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to think critically about the political, economic, ethical, and cultural complexities of health care under socialism and the neoliberal transition.",

Marvelous and monstrous beings can represent crucial cultural anxieties or imaginaries, such as deep social fears about change through secularization, modernization, and changing understandings of markers of modern identity such as gender, sexuality, race, and species or life-forms. What do these fascinating figures reveal about the self, which is often perceived through the (mis)recognition of others and an individual's conflictual desires? To what end do we continue to produce expressions of socio-political, psychological and historical ambiguity through representations of life forms perceived to be marvelous or monstrous? Through a selection of narrative fiction, visual representation, films, and critical essays, this seminar examines significant sites of cultural fascination and the anxieties played out in these representations. As our course is a First-Year Seminar, we will also discuss various aspects of college academic life, as well as working towards a consolidation and an expansion of  analytical and writing skills that you have already developed during your first year as a university student.",

The shtetl is the central locus and focus of Modern Yiddish Literature; Fiddler on the Roof itself was based on a Sholem Aleichem story. In this seminar we shall explore the spectrum of representations of the shtetl in Yiddish literature from the nineteenth century to the post-Holocaust period. We shall also focus on artistic and photographic depictions of the shtetl: Chagall and Roman Vishniac in particular. The course will include a screening of Fiddler on the Roof followed by a discussion of this film based upon a comparison with the text upon which it is based, Tevye the Milkman.",

To complicate things further, all of these beings are in constant movement, often revealing themselves to be different from what they initially were taken to be. But what they all have in common is a very special and difficult-to-define relationship to the narrative in and through which they appear. This course seeks to focus specifically on the relation between the narrative and the \"animals\" and quasi-animals that are often its subject. Ultimately it seeks to pose the question of the role of the reader and of reading in relating to what seems both irreducibly strange and yet uncannily familiar - what we call \"animals\".",

    "ClassOverview": "Jesus is certainly a central figure for Christianity and usually thought to mark decisive differences between the religions: the idea of an embodied God is as alien to Judaism as the concept of trinity or the belief in a substitutionary sacrificial death. Considering this, it seems very remarkable that at a closer look, figurations of Jesus abound in Jewish literature. In the seminar we will concentrate on the realm of German language texts from the 18th century to the present dealing with Jesus or related symbols like the cross or scenes of the Passion and Crucifixion. Not surprisingly, in Christian as well as Jewish contexts mixing religious symbolism in literature and art repeatedly provoked scandals. Authors like Carl Einstein were fined for blaspheming Christ, while others like Stefan Zweig, Alfred D\u00f6blin or Franz Werfel were accused of having betrayed Judaism.One hypothesis concerning this corpus of texts is that by adopting central narratives and images of the Christian majority society they claim Jewish participation and explore its limits. By focusing on Jesus as a Jew many of these texts rewrite and transform dominant Christian perspectives and expose their inherent violence. If they present the martyred Jesus explicitly as a Jew e.g., connections to persecutions, pogroms and genocide are evoked. At the same time, questions concerning a shared history and modes of respect despite difference are raised. We will discuss how texts problematize assimilation and also try to understand the role of (trans-)figurations of Jesus in 20th Jewish literature about war, the Shoah and the modes of memory.",

Throughout the quarter, we will be reading and discussing texts that address theoretical issues pertaining to language learning, pedagogy, and curriculum and we will examine these issues from the practical context of the language classroom and draw explicit linkage between theory and practice. In that sense, German 405 is neither a basic \"how to\" course for teaching methods, nor a pure Second Language Acquisition course. Rather, by engaging in a discussion of major questions and issues important for a number of interrelated fields such as linguistics, second language acquisition, sociolinguistics, education and language pedagogy, students will be introduced to the practice of self-directed and reflective teaching. This means that students are expected to evaluate theories and research, as well as their own assumptions concerning language learning and teaching. Topics to be covered include:\u2022\tThe role of methodology in teaching and learning: Historical trends and research evidence.\u2022\tThe nature of teaching and instructed learning: The classroom.\u2022\tThe roles of the teacher and the learner.\u2022\tThe comprehension-oriented modalities: Reading and listening.\u2022\tThe production-oriented modalities: Speaking and writing.\u2022\tAssessment within the teaching-learning context.\u2022\tAddressing diverse needs of learners in the language classroom.\u2022\tCross-cultural competence\u2022\tThe role of technology",

Hence, rather than reconstructing the \u2018original' early modern Baroque, we will focus on the question what kind of Baroque is created through its recent applications to literature and cultural theory, which connect to early 20th century discourse formations (e.g. W\u00f6lfflin, Benjamin, Wellek). How do they recode \u2018the Baroque' and why? What is new about the Neobaroque? Where does its particular quality lie, locally and globally?

We will read histories of this period and memoirs by movement participants, but our focus will be on engaging in collective archival research and, ultimately curating collections of (8-10) documents that aid us in recuperating these instances of successful coalition building across anti-war, women's and gay liberation, and black power/ethnic nationalist movements, as well as the intersectional politics that informed these collaborative projects. The seminar will meet in Special Collections and will introduce students to the practice of archival research as well as the remarkable range of archival materials housed in Special Collections, which might form the basis for research projects during your four years at Northwestern.

We begin with the \u2018culture wars' of the 1980s and the emergence of a reproductive politics (newly) figured in terms of \"pro-life vs. pro-choice\" and interrogate the extent to which this rendering continues to shape how we think about \"reproduction\" in the present. We then turn to the pre-history of this moment to explore the very different terms, demands and imaginaries that shaped the reproductive politics of 1970s-era liberation projects committed to \"reproductive freedom\" (e.g. feminist \"self-help clinics\"; Black Panther Party \"community survival programs\"; the free clinic movement; etc.). In the final unit, we investigate how the analyses and demands of a resurgent Reproductive Justice Movement led by women of color reconceptualizes and expands the terrain of reproductive politics to include demands for racial, economic and environmental justice as prerequisites for exercising the right to have or not to have children and to parent the children we do have. In addition to course materials, our collective research into this topic will include 1-2 weeks of (guided) archival research in Deering Library's Special Collections &/or University Archives.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course examines contemporary discussions on the topics of gender, sexuality, and disability in South Korea. The past decade has seen an explosion of popular interest in feminism in South Korea. Along with this were competing debates on social and economic inequalities and legislations, as well as debates on gender identity, everyday experiences of discrimination, and overlooked sites of intersectional violence. From the Gangnam station murder to the #Me Too movement, South Korean cultural industry's rise into the global stage through K-Pop has coincided with intense debates at home and abroad about the experience of gendered citizenship and various forms of marginalization. As the scholar Alison Kafer has poignantly shown, thinking through the entanglements of feminist, queer, and disability concerns is important to rethinking exclusionary claims and their attendant problems. Students will look at some of the major points of debate and events that have ignited the increased interest, engaging literary and popular cultural texts, news articles, and scholarship on feminist, queer, and crip theories. At the same time, these recent debates are not necessarily unique or new. To address such, the course will also consider the broader historical context of militarization, colonialism, and the Korean diaspora that have shaped these debates. No prerequisite knowledge of the Korean language or culture is necessary. As a discussion-based seminar with papers, the course encourages students to hone their critical thinking, speaking, and writing skills.",

From Black owned \u2018picture palaces' in the 1910s to Indigenous women creating VR in the 2010s, this course centers an understanding of women, LGBTQ+, and BIPOC as consistent designers and users of emerging technology.Each week will center around scholarly and primary source materials that illuminate perspectives on how gender and race informed the dynamic relationship between users and technology. This approach will attune students to the lengthy history of new media and technology and the unique and recurrent debates that emerge. It will also offer students the opportunity to study and apply critical gender and racial theory approaches in a media studies context. Class assessment will draw from current approaches in digital humanities. Students will gain practice navigating web based archives for their research and using web based platforms including Slack, Medium, Canva, Soundcloud, and video sharing platforms to present their ideas and research.",

We will trace the development of both the term queer and the history of queer theory, beginning with foundational essays by queer theorists by Eve Sedgwick, Judith Butler, Michael Warner and Lauren Berlant. We will then read both canonical essays by a variety of queer theorists and essays questioning the politics of a Queer Theory canon and how that might politically occlude relevant voices and non-binary participants such as trans and BIPOC populations. These theoretical texts are placed in dialogue analyzing several contemporary fiction and film. Seminar discussions require synchronous participation. They query how queer theory formulates racial, class and national identities in relation to sexuality, and how it might offer politics beyond those based on identity.

    "ClassOverview": "The aim of this seminar is to introduce students to the history and historiography of race and gender during the Holocaust. As in many historical contexts, race and gender interacted dynamically and created the particular context of Nazi-occupied Europe, which was a place where Jewish men and women suffered in particular ways, German men and women participated in particular ways, and other racial groups - men and women alike - were targeted, collaborated, resisted and rescued. We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective. While they indeed embraced an anti-feminist stance, the Nazis nevertheless sought to incorporate \"German\" women into the national community and women participated actively in the implementation of Nazi racism.",

We will ask how women of color feminists in the 1980s challenged existing concepts of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and identity. We will distinguish women of color feminism from Black feminisms and Latinx feminisms, identifying the key solidarities, intimacies, and alliances that undergird the writings in this field. Course participants will also be asked to challenge their understandings of \"theory,\" examining the rigorous feminist thought at work in contemporary poetry, short stories, film, media, and visual art.Key texts will likely include This Bridge Called My Back, Dict\u00e9e, Sister Outsider, and Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, as well as essays from Barbara Smith, Barbara Christian, E. Patrick Johnson, Hortense Spillers, Grace Kyungwon Hong, and Treva Ellison.

Drawing upon foundational and newer works in the field, we will explore how the construction of these categories, rooted in biological essentialism, has had immense consequences for the enslaved and her descendants, indigenous peoples, other people of color, and women, queer, transgender, and gender-nonconforming individuals. The historical record shows that individuals born cisgender male and socialized as men, namely white heterosexual men, have historically and contemporaneously dominated and controlled the North Americas and the globe. They have upheld their hegemonic and institutional power by wielding the social constructions of \"gender\" and \"sexuality\" to their benefit, often using religion, and specifically white Christianities, biblical fundamentalism, and \"religio-racial race making\" to regulate sexual bodies gendered and understood as non-white and non-man. This course examines the interconnected histories of race, sexuality and religion in the Americas through the vantage point of African American Studies, and specifically Black Queer Studies, and charts the construction of these categories and how racialized people\u2014both within and beyond religious institutions\u2014have resisted and challenged their centrality.",

All scientific data points to the conclusion that decisive and immediate action will be necessary to avoid significant damage to global ecosystems and communities by 2030. This course starts from this sense of urgency and the risk it runs of cuing interventions that, while efficient and effective, entrench existing inequalities. Instead, how can we be mindful of environmental solutions forwarded by marginalized communities? How might changes in global environmental policy also usher in changes in global social justice?In this course, we examine these foundational questions of environmental justice (EJ). While our reading list is catered to feminist environmentalist (FE) thought, the activists, artists, writers, and researchers we discuss tackle their work with varied critical identities. Through class discussions and presentations, students will build skills in understanding and evaluating public policy from EJ and FE lenses. Our close analysis of environmental policies and movements is complemented by foundational readings in EJ and FE history. This culminates in a final project of rhetorical analysis on an environmental policy or movement of the student's choosing.

We will engage with and critically discuss texts from the fields of legal studies, K-12 and higher education, sociology, philosophy, race/ethnic studies, and disability studies, with a commitment to centering the experiences and perspectives of trans and non-binary people both inside and outside of the academy. The questions we ask in this course include the following: How is the gender binary deeply woven into the policies and practices of social institutions such as education? How does genderism overlap and interact with other forms of oppression such as racism and ableism? For whom does the new visibility of trans identity benefit, and who does it harm? How can we transform educational contexts to be attuned to gender diversity, particularly as it intersects with issues of race/ethnicity, disability, citizenship, and social class?

Together, we will engage texts and materials that push back on normative understandings of belonging, especially through contemporary conversations of race, gender, class, and sexuality. Drawing from the literature of anthropology, psychoanalysis, queer theory, critical race theory, feminist studies, and the broader social sciences, we will question and reenvision themes such as the family, reproduction, friendship, monogamy, community, and home.

We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, and official categorization to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy, classification systems, and citizenship? How have movements and counter-movements around the transformation of gender developed, and how have gendered divides influenced politics of all sorts? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include grassroots democratic activism, the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as examining formal politics and policies. We will read and discuss scholars drawing on diverse theoretical and methodological traditions, and we engage with analyses of a variety of contexts across the world (the US, other rich capitalist democracies, postcolonial states and beyond), striving to situate states and political mobilization in global contexts.

In Hebrew 121-3, taught in the Spring quarter, we will expand our knowledge of past tense verbs to forms of \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc \u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05dd (\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1, \u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d5\u05dc, \u05dc\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3) and \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc \u05dc\"\u05d4 (\u05dc\u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea, \u05dc\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea) and\u05e4\u05d9\u05e2\u05dc (\u05dc\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8, \u05dc\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8) and  \u05d4\u05e4\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc (\u05dc\u05d4\u05d6\u05de\u05d9\u05df, \u05dc\u05d4\u05e8\u05d2\u05d9\u05e9)and \u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc (\u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05e8\u05d2\u05e9, \u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05dc\u05d1\u05e9). These variety of forms will allow us to develop our self-expression and to include writing and conversations about childhood memories, everyday situations like visit at the doctor, volunteering in organizations, and more. We will learn more prepositions and their conjugations (like \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9, \u05e9\u05dc\u05da) and more useful grammar structures like \u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05da, \u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05dc, \u05d0\u05e4\u05e9\u05e8.

These were the people who because of their low social status, rural origins, illiteracy, or unpopular beliefs were ignored, despised, or persecuted by the dominant society.

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Repairing Historical InjusticesRepairing Historical Injustices  Repairing historical injustices is one of the most debated topics in today's society in many countries on every continent. Restitution (return of confiscated property), reparations (various forms of material compensation for what cannot be returned physically), and apologies (public recognition of wrongdoing and assuming responsibility for it) are perhaps the most widespread transitional justice methods used to amend the massive breaches of human rights perpetrated by colonial empires, dictatorships, authoritarian regimes, and democracies throughout history. Slowly emerging after World War II, the theory and practice of restitution, reparations, and apologies have developed tremendously especially since the 1990s, even though many governments and citizens are still reluctant to accept them. Which were the most well-known and controversial cases of restitution, reparations, and apologies around the globe during the last 75 years and how were they justified, opposed, and implemented? Is the boom of restitution, reparations, and apologies the sign of a new international morality and democratization spreading worldwide? This course investigates these questions by focusing on theories and cases studies of repairing historical injustices perpetrated by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in Europe (against the victims of the Holocaust and the Gulag), by colonial Empires and settler democracies in the Americas, Australia, and Africa (against Native Americans, African Americans, Japanese Americans, Africans, Australian aboriginals, the Maori of New Zeeland, and Indonesians), by the Japanese Imperial Army in World War II Asia (against the victims of sexual slavery, the so-called \"comfort women\"), and by the apartheid regime in South Africa (against black Africans).",

In this course we will look at racial ideology, but also at laws, policies, and practices that have made \"white\" a privileged social position. We cover the development of New World slavery and race-based labor regimes, laws controlling access to public spaces and goods based on race, how state and federal policies controlled the unequal distribution of education, housing, and property, and we also examine how different immigrant groups have had access to \"whiteness\" over time.The course is reading and writing-intensive.

Since the birth of the motion picture, films portraying Native Americans (often with non-Native actors in redface) have drawn upon earlier frontier mythology, art, literature, and Wild West performances. These depictions in film have embedded romanticized and stereotyped ideas about American Indians in the imaginations of audiences throughout the United States and around the world. In this course, we will critically examine representations of Native Americans in film, ranging from the origins of the motion picture industry to the works of contemporary Indigenous filmmakers. We will reflect upon revisionist narratives, the use of film as a form of activism, Indigenous aesthetics and storytelling techniques, reflexivity, and parody. Throughout the quarter, we will discuss ethnographic, documentary, and narrative films.",

This cascade of dramatic struggles between democracy and aristocracy, freedom and slavery, independence and colonialism, created a new world order as well as key components of our ongoing social reality: socialism, capitalism, liberalism, conservatism, terrorism, and perhaps most importantly revolution itself, an eruption of sudden and epochal social transformation which has electrified some people and terrified others ever since.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Global History of Prisons and CampsPrisons and jails across the globe currently hold more than 10 million people, approximately one-fifth of them in the United States alone. In addition to those formally sentenced by courts, over the past two centuries numerous regimes have ordered the confinement of tens of millions more in enclosed camps of various sorts. Based on the recent past, it might be difficult to imagine a time when mass confinement did not seem an inevitable response of states to peoples considered to be dangerous, but the practice of imprisoning large numbers of people for extended periods of time is, historically speaking, a recent development. A momentously consequential development that, this course hypothesizes, is at once a product of the modern state and a constituent element of the modern era.This course examines the history of two different institutions of confinement - the prison and the camp - that traditionally have been studied separately. With often enormous differences in the degree of regulation and brutality - a critical consideration the course will always keep in mind - those in power have used prisons and camps to control and subdue racial, religious, and other identified groups, and to exploit their labor for public and private use. Cynically or not, authorities have justified confinement as a necessary means to achieve justice, protect society, and rehabilitate the condemned. Irrespective of the great variety of pretexts under which regimes have imprisoned citizens and subjects and the patently immense disparaties in the treatment of those confined, there have been and remain common elements to both the physical structures of incarceration and the lived experiences of prisoners that this course aims to explore and discuss.  The quarter begins with a consideration of alternate forms of punishment common to the premodern era and then follows the development and spread of the modern prison and the proliferation of mass detention camps across the globe over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries until the present day.",

Considering both how the state regulated families as well as the many functional families and kinships that existed without state sanction, this course highlights the importance of families in societies and political thought, as well as the lived experience of families in America. As we range over diverse family experiences, we will also follow specific families through time in order to understand how historical changes shaped their family structures.

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Modern Israel: History, Politics and Society, 1882-presentThe history of modern Israel can be seen as chronicling the challenge of building a brand new state and society bringing Jews of many different persuasions to live together for the first time in 2000 years while simultaneously confronting the reality of an indigenous population within its territorial bounds. This course takes the approach that the history of modern Israel is a dual narrative of two nations developing side-by-side in the same geographic space of Israel/Palestine, each seeking their own self-determination and social cohesion. Yet, as this course will emphasize, the history and historiography of modern Israel go far beyond the \"ripped from the headlines and history books\" accounts of decades of clashes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- we will examine the complex internal dynamics of each society-in-progress as well as the external processes that shaped both of their polities and their quest for peace. The syllabus has been organized in 8 week units as departures on the theme of \"aliya\" (lit. ascendance), a Zionist concept that has attached a positive and religiously-infused valance to Jewish national project and wave of immigrant-absorption prior to the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. I have adapted this framework not only to cover both the pre- and post-state period in Israel/Palestine but also to put into focus many groups that were marginalized from this classic history of modern Israel. We will examine both continuity and change since 1948 when it came to the creation of the \"new Jew,\" successive waves of Jewish migration, Zionist settlement, and the \"Arab\" (or Palestinian) question. The goal of the course is gain a deeper appreciation of not only of the wars on the battlefield and between world leaders over the past century, but the major political, social, cultural, and religious trends that have profoundly shaped two societies in conflict -- and perhaps one day, conciliation. The course will draw not only from scholarly texts but memoir, literature, photography, film, music, and other forms of digital history to gain a multi-faceted view of the modern Israel. Lastly, students will have the opportunity apply their historical knowledge to contemporary debates about the future of the region.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: History of the BalkansStarting in the 19th century, in the Western European colonial and postcolonial imagination, the Balkans became the typical locus of Orientalism at the fringe of Europe, depicted as a place of socio-economic backwardness, bloodthirsty tribalism, and ingrained inter-ethnic and inter-religious hatred and violence. These myths worsened during the twentieth century when the Balkans were seen as the source of instability, war, and political chaos and fragmentation that threatened the other parts of the \"civilized\" and \"peaceful\" Europe. For example, the inhabitants of the Balkans, their states, and organizations were blamed for triggering World War I (WWI), conducting \"uncivilized\" warfare (during the Balkan Wars, WWI, and WWII), and pursuing ethnic cleansing or even genocide during the 1990s disintegration of Yugoslavia. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, at the end of WWI, the Western civilization even coined a new term \"Balkanization\" to depict the ethnic and political fragmentation into smaller ethnic states of the multinational and multi-confessional Ottoman Empire as a result of allegedly irreconcilable religious and ethnic divisions, and the ensuing chaos and violence: \"The term Balkanization is today invoked to explain the disintegration of some multi-ethnic states and their devolution into dictatorship, ethnic cleansing, and civil war.\"   But as historians such as Arnold Toynbee and Mark Mazower have pointed out, the region of the Balkans - encompassing the modern states of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Yugoslavia and its successor states (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Northern Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia, Montenegro, and Kosovo) - harbored significant traditions of multiculturality, multi-confessionalism, and peaceful coexistence, and was not more violent than other parts of Europe and the world. Specifically, the Balkan states did not invent and export the most radical and murderous ideologies of the twentieth century - fascism/Nazism and communism - and did not initiate the most extensive genocides of the 20th century, such as the Holocaust and the Gulag.What was/is the Balkans, what happened in that region during the twentieth century, and why does its history matter? During the twentieth century, the Balkans emerged as one of the most important sites of conflict for the European Great Powers, a place where ideologies such as ethno-nationalism, fascism, communism, and liberal democracy, clashed and competed for influence. The inhabitants of the Balkans have also witnessed a series of transitions - from empire to nation states, from occupation to freedom, from war and civil war to peace, from fascism to communism and from the latter to liberal democracy - that shaped their lives in a major way. This course will examine the political, economic, and socio-cultural history of the region since 1900, from the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the emergence (or enlargement) of the local nation states to the anti-communist revolutions of 1989-1990, and the transition periods that shaped the region which became known as Southeastern Europe.",

But he was also in his own way white, a fellow Spaniard called Gonzalo Guerrero, and his three children, born of marriage with a Maya woman, might be seen as the first Mexicans. The history of Mexico, understood as the country and people that grew from those first contacts, began with that Spaniard in 1511 when his caravel foundered on Scorpion Reef over sixty miles north of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula.

It explores the history and culture of the first socialist state from the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution through the 1991 \"velvet\" rebellion that resulted in the collapse of communism. This course looks at the communist polity through the perspective of its ordinary people. From kindergarten to their old age, the Soviet people encounter on daily basis the rattling Soviet propaganda, the communist party symbols and various Orwellian discourses on the proletarian truth and the class struggle to which everybody was supposed to kowtow. While the majority was comfortable with such state of things, many discovered racism behind the internationalist slogans, xenophobia behind the mottos of the brotherhood of ethnicities, ultra-conservatism behind the leftist philosophy and chauvinism that replaced the officially acknowledged ethnic equality. What does this mean for our understanding of communism as praxis? Students will study the dichotomy of the official and the non-official that shaped everyday life of a Soviet individual, will ponder the ways the Soviet ordinary people negotiated their collaboration with the communist institutions, and will seek to answer  major question: How it was possible to remain a person of integrity in the world of the officially imposed cynicism and hypocrisy.",

American intervention in Vietnam was also the paradigmatic expression of US foreign policy and the men who made it between 1945-1975, which is why the failures of that policy transformed US politics. This course examines these historical developments through a close study of the Vietnam Wars in global perspective while also attending to developments inside the United States and in Vietnam.

    "ClassOverview": "Catastrophic events in the twentieth century (two world wars, the Russian Revolution, world economic depression, the Nazi counter-revolution and Holocaust, and threat of nuclear war) set into clear relief key terms we hear bantered in the news today.  What does fascism mean?  What is socialism?  Is capitalism inherently democratic?  Through the lens of gender and sexuality studies, these regimes take on an extraordinary clarity, differentiating along distinct family and gender ideals, sexual freedom, reproductive rights, and personal expressions.  Most importantly, these rival regimes developed dynamically in relation to each other and as responses to the crisis of total war.  During World War One, military strategy and technology blurred the boundaries between war zones and home fronts.  Not only did civilian populations become military targets, but the strains of war also exposed them to food shortages, fuel rationing, forced evacuations, and violent death.  At the same time, disillusioned soldiers and veterans saw their war experiences through the threat of gender inversions.  During the war, women had been mobilized to do men's work.  In the 1920s and \u201830s, the \"new woman\" of the century - building on the beginnings of legal equality and the vote - enjoyed greater economic, political, intellectual, and sexual freedoms than their nineteenth century grandmothers and great-grandmothers.  If conventional warfare was defined by (and reinforced) traditional notions of heterosexuality, did the disruption of those norms mean emancipation for women?  Did wars invite utopian hopes for alternate gender and sexual alignments and identities?  Through novels, memoirs, primary documents, films, and propaganda art, we study the individual and collective biographies of people who struggled and thrived through these changes.  Despite the much-touted return to happy domesticity after the half century of total war and revolutions, could the genie of sexual malcontent be ever fully re-contained?",

Throughout the course, we will explore the tension between provincialism and cosmopolitanism in its political, social, and intellectual dimensions.",

This class interprets health and healing broadly and, as such, we will be considering histories of colonialism and state violence, struggles for sovereignty and self-governance, environmental justice, food and nutrition, biomedical research, and biopolitics in both reservation and urban settings. We will ask questions like: How have doctors and scientists and explained the health disparities that Indigenous peoples experience? How has medicine produced definitions of indigeneity? How have Indigenous healing practices persisted and transformed? Can medicine be decolonized and what role might it play in Indigenous sovereignty? In our effort to explore complex historiographical and methodological issues, we will be reading literature from a range of fields\u2014including the history of science and medicine, Indigenous studies, anthropology, science and technology studies, Native American history, and environmental history\u2014and discussing how scholars across disciplines have grappled with the complex relationships that exist between indigeneity, health, and settler colonialism. Finally, we will turn our analytical lens back on ourselves and consider the ethics and politics of various forms of historical inquiry.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Gender Race, and the HolocaustThe aim of this seminar is to introduce students to the history and historiography of race and gender during the Holocaust. As in many historical contexts, race and gender interacted dynamically and created the particular context of Nazi-occupied Europe, which was a place where Jewish men and women suffered in particular ways, German men and women participated in particular ways, and other racial groups - men and women alike - were targeted, collaborated, resisted and rescued. We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective. While they indeed embraced an anti-feminist stance, the Nazis nevertheless sought to incorporate \"German\" women into the national community and women participated actively in the implementation of Nazi racism.",

Ultimately, the course is about the ways in which different historians have understood and interpreted the events that unfolded during this time period. Imagine that you and your classmates are a group of conscientious lawyers examining a case ahead of a trial. In this hypothetical scenario, one party has put forward a case based on a certain narrative of events. Out of concern for its accuracy and plausibility, your task is to determine if, or to what extent, it holds water. The case in question has been put forward by historian Elizabeth Thompson in a recent book dealing with Syria and the Arabs' quest for independence following WWI. We are going to familiarize ourselves with the facts of the case and the case itself. Then we are going to scrutinize the argument, weigh the evidence, consider alternatives, and assess the extent to which the case withstands scrutiny.",

Participants in this course will explore expressions and artifacts of Catholicism in Latin America (the former colonies of Spain and Portugal), with special attention to the various texts, objects, and living communities that have allowed scholars to make sense of religious practice and experience. We will consider ways of thinking and writing about religion, with emphasis on recent developments and interdisciplinary exchanges, as well as reasons for paying attention. How has an appreciation of the human and divine, sacraments, saints, lay associations, and ritual specialists illuminated topics of historical study, including slavery, gender, migration, labor regimes, colonialism, nationalism, and of course, religion?",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: The Establishment and Its Critics\"The Establishment\" as a term used to describe a small group of insiders or an entrenched power structure that exerts secret, shadowy, or outsized influence over our lives, politics, and culture has become ubiquitous in contemporary discourse. Yet the term is relatively recent in origin, emerging in the 1950s and '60s, and it sprang from political concerns and social conditions particular to that time, making possible a populist critique of power that gave rise to both the New Left and the New Right, and helped usher in the hyper-partisan politics of our own time. This seminar gives students the opportunity to write an original research paper on a question of their choice related to the utility and application of \"the establishment\" in the study of modern US History. After a few weeks of introductory readings to give students a grasp of the origins, spread, and scope of this concept, the remainder of the course will be devoted to developing and refining individual research projects related to it. That research may range from writing about particular people, practices, or institutions associated with \"the establishment,\" to attempts to prove or disprove its influence, to investigations into previously unidentified instances of it, to meditations on why this concept has proved useful and enduring in so many contexts. The course is broadly defined to allow almost any student with a background in recent US or world history to fulfill their 395 requirement, and it lends itself to the sort of research than can be done online using electronic resources in the event we are unable to meet in person or conduct research using library print materials. Students who wish to research \"the establishment\" in contexts outside the United States or earlier than the twentieth-century may do so only with the consent of the instructor.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Holocaust TrialsAfter the Second World War the victorious Allied powers and the liberated peoples of Europe engaged in an unprecedented attempt to bring Nazi war criminals and domestic collaborators to justice. Courts throughout the continent tried and punished hundreds of thousands for having worked with and for Germany and the Axis powers. By and large, however, those trials concentrated on crimes of political collaboration and paid little attention to what is now accepted as the Nazis' greatest crime: the genocide of European Jewry. Although courts did punish some architects of the so-called Final Solution, thousands of Europeans who had organized, perpetrated or otherwise contributed to the Holocaust escaped with minimal penalties or no punishment at all. Over the subsequent decades individuals, organizations, and states have sought to redress the failure to seek out and punish those perpetrators at war's end. Lawyers have prosecuted and defended accused war criminals before courts. Historians have documented the development and execution of genocide, while others have sought to deny the very murders themselves. Through the examination of a series of trials, the first half of the course will discuss both the struggle to bring perpetrators to justice and the efforts to obscure the crimes that had been committed. We will consider the prosecution of war crimes and genocide in the context of the development of international law and historical knowledge over the decades from the Second World War to the present day.  For the second half of the course students will concentrate on individual research papers based on primary sources (for example, the records of the Nuremberg Tribunal or Eichman Trial).",

Yet the purpose of the autobiography is to tell the story, not history, therefore autobiography is a quintessential narrative that borders on the literary. If so, is it possible to use autobiography in historical research? This course opens up a variety of ways to identify literary layers in autobiography to analyze it as a usable historical source. This course takes the participants through five hundred years of Jewish ego-narratives including the autobiographies of rabbis and mystics, schismatics and philosophers, merchants and writers, dissidents and historians, politicians, and converts. This course is a rare opportunity to look at Jewish history through the perspective of people who built their agency by telling their stories.",

    "ClassOverview": "Topic: Global ChinaEarly modern and modern world history is a story of cultural, economic, and biological exchange. Modern China emerged in part from global currents that also transformed other places. This seminar will attempt the impossible task of discerning how ideas, people, and things circulated among China, \"the West,\" (a handy, sometimes useless term that usually refers to Europe and Great Britain but also enables us to turn to the U.S. when necessary), Japan, and Southeast Asia from roughly 1500 to the mid-twentieth century. We will attempt to address three huge, complicated, questions: How did global trends influence the emergence of modern China? How did China contribute to the transformation of the modern world? How did the cultural encounter between China and the West affect the course of history? We will read some of the important new work that attempts to answer these questions. Students will then write a term paper on a particular issue of interest to them. Students who do not specialize in the discipline of history are welcome and may write a term paper using the methods of their own discipline.",

Against this backdrop, this course grapples with the politics of memory, history, and community.

The course will use Puerto Rican Chicago and the Puerto Rican Chicago Archive project as a case study. At least once in the term, the class will travel to Humboldt Park to participate in a memory tour and visit the archive.",

Overall, how do developments in the life sciences affect our understandings of who we are, how we differ, and how social inequalities are created, perpetuated, and challenged? This seminar explores how scientific claims and technological developments help transform cultural understandings of race, gender, and sexuality. Conversely, we will consider how cultural beliefs about race, gender, and sexuality influence scientific knowledge and medical practice. We will take up a series of controversies from the recent past and present to explore the dynamic interplay between expert findings, social identities, and political arguments.",

    "ClassOverview": "If all seasoned politicians in a fragile democracy are implicated in wide-scale corruption, but if the country is facing an acute economic crisis requiring experience at the helm, what should be done about the corrupt, and who should decide? What compromises, if any, are appropriate when considering kleptocrats who are effectively holding their people hostage - for instance, rulers who systematically abuse loans from foreign creditors, but who rely on the fact that their vulnerable population will suffer if loans are cut off entirely? What compromises, if any, are morally appropriate when dealing with dictators who threaten to unleash violence unless they are guaranteed an amnesty by the democratic forces trying to replace them? This upper-level seminar delves into such fraught political problems, revolving around different kinds of corruption and abuse of political power. In order to grapple with these problems, we examine in detail two ideas related to \"the people.\" The first is the idea of the sovereign people as the owner of public property, often stolen by corrupt politicians. The second is the idea of the people as an agent with its own moral integrity - an integrity that might bear on intricate policy dilemmas surrounding the proper response to corruption. In the process of examining both of these ideas, students will acquire familiarity with prominent philosophical treatments of integrity, property, and - more generally - public policy.",

Staging the Bible will explore theatrical projects that aim to \"bring the Bible to life\" through adaptation. We will study biblical performances as objects of analysis and performance as a critical paradigm for understanding religious expression in the contemporary United States of America. The course will explore theatre productions that dramatize the Bible, ranging from traditional passion plays to Broadway musicals like Jesus Christ Superstar and postmodern adaptations like Terrence McNally's Corpus Christi. We will investigate Evangelical projects that use theatrical apparatuses to proselytize across various sites, like Megachurches, Christian theme parks, and Creation Museums. This course mixes lectures, discussions, in class exercises, and co-curricular experiences beyond the classroom to survey multiple intersections of contemporary American Christianity and theatrical adaptation of scripture. All course materials will be provided via Canvas to students at no cost.",

    "ClassOverview": "Formerly called primitive art and also known as the Arts of Africa, Oceania and The Americas, Non-Western art is a geographically-expansive category connected by the histories of imperialism that brought the art and artifacts from colonized people across the world into Western museums. In fact, many of the objects that comprise this canon are oftentimes not \"objects\" at all. Taking a decolonial approach to study the canon of Non-Western art, this course addresses the animacies and ontologies of different categories of \"objects\" in museum collections, including materially-embodied deities such as Katsina dolls (Hopi) and Orishas (Yoruba diaspora); ancestors that take form as seeds (Pueblo) and ceramics (Mimbres), and materials such as feathers (Aztec, Tupinamba, Hawaiian) and pipestone (Lakota, Dakota and Yankton Sioux) that mediate different realms of existence. The class will also consider the remains of humans, plants, and animals housed in anthropology and natural history museums. The question of objecthood also applies to people conceptualized as property, sold as commodities and displayed within ethnographic and World's Fair contexts as well as the land upon which museums are built. We will learn about some of the ways that these \"objects\" entered into museums as we compare the Western epistemologies by which they are organized there to the indigenous ontologies they occupy within their cultures of origin.",

    "ClassOverview": "What do Jonathan Swift's pamphlet A Modest Proposal (1729) and Jordan Peele's horror film Get Out (2017) have in common?  Swift proposes that English landowners in Ireland consider eating the infants of impoverished Irish natives; Peele represents an upper-crust white Connecticut family that steals the brains of Black people.  This class will examine the literary genre that Swift and Peele exploit to devastating critical effect:  satire.  We'll devote special attention to satire's key paradox:  for those who get it (or think they do), satire signifies by not signifying what it literally says.  We will explore high points in the history of satire, beginning with classical authors (Horace, Juvenal) to ponder how satire frames deep ethical concerns about social and political life.  Then we'll read satires from the British eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, grouped into units on sexuality, sex work, marriage, and family; social class and criminality; and empire and race.  The class ends with twentieth- and twenty-first-century film and TV to consider how satire continues to confront crises of our present historical moment.",

    "ClassOverview": "(Im)material layers in archives: Affect, Landscapes and Photographic Agency at the Arab Image Foundation (AIF)This seminar will investigate the ways in which archives can function as a space for renegotiating the agency of photographs and their (im)material layers, and how these processes can allow for rethinking archival practices in complex political, economic, and social contexts today.Considering the Arab Image Foundation's (AIF) efforts to critically engage with its research and preservation practices, including documentation, technological solutions, and questions around custodianship, rights and access, a particular focus will address diverse methodologies of generating layers of documentation through encountering and witnessing archival material in specific settings.Additionally, we will explore specific pirate or subversive digital projects, traditional/local knowledge archives, and their related contracts' use of radical descriptions and language, which may offer new ways to reclaim and reassert control over certain narratives. This, in turn, will allow us to understand how reframing the same archival items can shift how people search and read records.For example, in the collections from Burj al-Shamali camp, Yasmine Eid-Sabbagh has over many years tried to give disembodied layers the same status as the material layers of photographs in order to address the emotional dimensions of trauma, silence, refusal, resistance and other affects unleashed by these photographs.Looking at the AIF's Armenian collections will enable an investigation into how dispossession and perpetual migration have defined the presence and absence of Armenians in Ottoman landscapes and how varied methods of documentation might intervene in these historic and contemporary landscapes.The sessions, articulated through lectures, practice-based workshops, and public events, will be led by three members of the current Board of Directors of the AIF: Vartan Avakian, Yasmine Eid-Sabbagh and Kristine Khouri.Participants will learn, explore, and generate new knowledge by working on collections from the Arab Image Foundation and related projects.",

What emerging performance genres\u2014from vaxxies to mental health TikTok videos and from Zoom performances to Instagram livestreams\u2014have taken off during the last two years of social isolation and polarization? What digital aesthetic strategies link personal experience to collective crisis and action? How have artists and activists drawn attention to issues such as anti-Blackness, gender violence, and authoritarianism and their imbrication in the current public health crisis? To address these questions, students will read scholarship on performance and new media, examine digital performances of their choosing, and produce critical essays and/or practice-based research projects that incorporate digital tools. By the end of the course, students will have gained skills to analyze digital performances, to think critically about liveness, embodiment, and mediated performance, and to share their research using a critical digital humanities approach.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course will examine international development aid as an instrument of foreign policy. It will focus on the role of aid in five main periods of U.S. foreign policy: 1) the Marshall Plan and the struggle for Europe (1945-1961), 2) superpower competition in the developing world (1961-1989), 3) aiding the transition to democratic governance (1989-present), 4) countering violent religious extremism in the Islamic world (2001-present), and 5) meeting the challenge of globalization (present day).We will look at how development aid emerged as a response to the superpower competition of the Cold War. The world's first major aid package, the Marshall Plan, was a key component in the U.S. strategy of containment: it was designed to prevent further Soviet encroachment into Central and Western Europe. With success of the Marshall Plan in Europe, Washington adopted foreign as a tool to contain the spread of Communism elsewhere, particularly in Southeast Asia and Latin America.With the end of the Cold War, the focus of development aid changed to reflect Washington's evolving strategic priorities. The collapse of the communist system in Eastern Europe led to the danger of conflict and instability there, and presented the U.S. with the new challenge of aiding the newly independent states with their transition to democracy and the market economy. Congress responded with the Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) Act for Eastern Europe, and the FREEDOM Support Act (FSA) in the former Soviet Union.The attack of September 11, 2001 awoke Washington to the danger of violent Islamic extremism. As in 1989, Congress responded to the need to counter this phenomenon with new aid packages. In this section of the course, we will focus primarily on efforts to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, both during and after U.S. military action there.Finally, we will conclude by looking at how the challenges of globalization, particularly climate change and emerging health threats, are shaping today's foreign aid strategies. In the final week, students will present their ideas for future directions for foreign aid, in the form a briefing on their final project -- a set of recommendations on development policy for a hypothetical President.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course will examine the roots and the drivers of Putin's foreign policy.  It will look at the factors leading to the USSR's disintegration and resulting ethnic conflicts, the security issues requiring responses from the U.S., and the decision-making processes in responding to these challenges.The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the twentieth century's last in a series of collapses of multinational empires, and it presented the U.S. with the most difficult security challenges. In the immediate aftermath, U.S. policy makers were faced with not one but four nuclear powers (Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus), thousands of under-secured nuclear weapons and under-paid nuclear scientists, and several armed secessionist conflicts in the Caucasus and Moldova.The course also will examine the security environment of the post-Cold War world, with a focus on Russia's efforts to assert what it sees as its right to a sphere of influence. The collapse of the USSR meant the end of an uneasy, but by and large consensual, international security system. Russia has shown a willingness to reject that consensus. It has proven deeply skeptical of Western support for the democratic aspirations of former Soviet states, willing even to use military force to deny countries like Ukraine and Georgia their sovereign rights to join NATO and the EU. Closer to home, it has employed various direct and indirect efforts to undermine Western solidarity and confidence in the liberal democratic system.As a final project, students will propose possible U.S. responses to a resurgent Russia.",

    "ClassOverview": "What does it mean to be healthy? In this seminar, students will examine how this seemingly simple question becomes more complex when looking at various cultural approaches to medicine, health, and wellness. Important topics that will be covered include indigenous understandings of health, the growth of biomedicine as a dominant paradigm across the globe, and transnational connectivity in addressing emerging health issues. Our discussions of these issues will focus on culture, gender, medicine, race, borders, activism, and (de)colonization. We will also discuss qualitative research methods, with special attention given to online/virtual research methods in an era of restricted international travel. Students will develop a refined research question and explore which methods are best suited to answering this question. Students will complete a polished 13-15 page research paper, with the following assignments spaced throughout the course to develop the paper: a research proposal, rough draft, peer review exercise, and final presentation. Throughout the course, we will engage perspectives from anthropology, history, journalism, political science, and sociology.",

    "ClassOverview": "Course Description:  In 2005, leaders from around the globe met to discuss how, for the first time in human history, over half of the world's population lives in cities (Crane and Kinzig 2005). In this class, we will examine how residents of cities throughout human history have used things to negotiate and shape urban life. By assessing the stuff that makes up cities, we will explore the concept of materiality, which refers to the physical objects or things that comprise human existence. We will ask: What is the material stuff that makes up urban environments? How do these materials shape the lived experiences of urban residents? And how do these objects, buildings, and spaces materially express social relationships and inequalities in cities? Once we have learned how to examine urbanism through material things, we will explore how these materials intersect with other areas of social life in cities and consider: How are social phenomena, such as religion, gender, and sexuality, materially shaped and shaped by the experiences of urban residents? How have marginalized residents used things to rework and navigate the challenges of urban life? To answer these questions, course materials will draw on an interdisciplinary collection (e.g. Anthropology, Archaeology, Geography, History, and more) of scholarship anchored around the interrogation of the materials that comprise urban life in the present but also in the distant past. Drawing on studies of urbanism throughout history and around the globe, students will learn how to see the long-term material relationships between people and urban environments and how they vary cross-culturally. By the end of the term, students will be able to communicate (to peers and the general public) how material things shape urban experience and be able to demonstrate, through their own analyses, how social phenomena are materially expressed in city life.",

    "ClassOverview": "Italy's Belcanto: Lyric & OperaThroughout the Renaissance, Italian has established itself as a truly European language of culture because of the Petrarchan tradition of love lyric. Just like most courtly poetry of the period, even Shakespeare's sonnets follow several schemes and stereotypes of Rerum Vulgarium Fragmenta, the masterpiece by Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374). At the end of the 16th century, with the birth of Italian melodrama pioneered by the likes of Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643), Italian rapidly became a language widely used by European courtiers and aristocrats, and operatic plays - whether of sacred or lay inspiration, Classical or Medieval - were more and more often performed in courtly contexts, especially to mark special occasions (weddings, victories, coronations and so forth). Italian was, more often than not, the language of such belcanto, and it rapidly became customary for high-class people to study it. In 17th-century England, for example, John Florio and Giovanni Torriano wrote dictionaries and grammars that became best sellers. This course will attempt to draw an outline of the early stages of operatic theatre in Europe, in association with the rapid spread of Petrarchism in the language and style of librettos that were set to music.",

    "ClassOverview": "Art and Science in Italian CookeryBefore the advent of anatomy and surgery in 16th century, with chemistry increasingly used for pharmacology soon after, the only way to intervene over human body was nutrition and medicines were essentially a combination of natural elements (\"semplici\"); thus, human complexion was seen - after a long Classical tradition started by the likes of Hyppocrates and Galenus - as a combination of elements whose balance could be threatened by illness and had to be restored by means of ingestion of counterbalancing principles. Consequently, there was a thin line between the principles of medicine and pharmacology on the one side and those of cookery on the other: the creation of some dishes - including some classics of Italian cuisine! - can indeed be understood as an attempt to create balanced food that respects the natural complexion of human beings. The course will introduce the principles of Medieval and Renaissance medicine and how they are reflected in contemporary cookbooks, with examples mainly from Italian texts of the 14th and 15th centuries, that will be examined in their specific language, often influenced by regionalism.",

The course combines a wide range of primary sources as well as cultural products of Jewish and Arabs writers, moviemakers, and artists.

    "ClassOverview": "This course approaches the history of modern Israel is a dual narrative of two nations developing side-by-side in the same geographic space of Israel/Palestine, each seeking their own self-determination and social cohesion. Yet, as this course will emphasize, the history and historiography of modern Israel go far accounts of decades of clashes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We will examine the complex internal dynamics of each society-in-progress as well as the external processes that shaped both of their polities and their quest for peace. We will examine both continuity and change since 1948 when it came to the creation of the \"new Jew,\" successive waves of Jewish migration, Zionist settlement, and the \"Arab\" (or Palestinian) question. The goal of the course is to gain a deeper appreciation of not only of the wars on the battlefield and between world leaders over the past century, but the major political, social, cultural, and religious trends that have profoundly shaped two societies in conflict --and perhaps one day, conciliation. The course will draw not only from scholarly texts but memoir, literature, photography, film, music, and other forms of digital history to gain a multi-faceted view of the modern Israel. Lastly, students will have the opportunity to apply their historical knowledge to contemporary debates about the future of the region.",

    "ClassOverview": "Most of the countries in the world, though notably not the United States, are nation-states, countries in which the \"nation\" (in the sense of a \"people\" or an \"ethnic group\") gives political expression to its nationhood. The nation-state, then, represents a nation's identity as a polity. So it is with Israel, a country conceived and defined as the nation-state of the Jewish people. But if Israel is the Jewish nation-state, in which the Jewish people predominate politically and numerically, then what of its non-Jews, some twenty percent of the country's population? This course surveys the history of minorities in Israel with special reference to their relations with the state and Jewish society. Beginning in the pre-state era, we will explore how minorities figured in early Zionist writings and what role Zionist thinkers imagined for minorities in the Jewish state-to-be. Then, moving from Zionist thought to Israeli experience, we will consider the complexities of minority citizenship in Israel, the place of minorities in Israeli society and politics, and landmark events in the history of Israeli minorities. Throughout the course, we will present Israel's minorities in both a collective and an individual light. In this way, we will review the similarities of circumstance and experience based on the minorities' common lot as non-Jews in a Jewish state, and we will profile specific Israeli minorities, among them Arab Muslims, Arab Christians, Bedouins, Druze, Circassians, Maronites, and Armenians. We will address ourselves to case studies that examine the historical dynamic between the state's policies toward four particular minorities and these minorities' attitudes toward the state. More specifically, we will assess levels of minority cooperation, disaffection, and accommodation with the state and where, between the two opposite poles of Israeli patriotism and Palestinian nationalism, the sentiments of different minorities have stood and why.",

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar will explore how the availability of water has shaped the development of civilizations and driven innovation in water technologies. The course will investigate historical dimensions of water in Israel and the Middle East, focusing on ancient civilizations and the water infrastructures that are essential tools in aiding the development of water-poor societies. We will use this historical context as a stepping-stone to transition into a more recent history of the Middle East, focusing on the challenges that the nascent state of Israel faced following the influx of millions of immigrants. We will then examine efforts to develop the necessary water resources needed to support the burgeoning population as well as the irrigation projects designed to convert barren desert land into cultivated agriculture. This more recent history will help to set the stage for discussions regarding geopolitical conflicts over land and water that continue to this day. We will evaluate regional climate and water in the context of current and future geopolitical conflicts, reviewing recent advances in water technologies spurred by these limitations as well as the potential development of combined social and technological solutions for long-term water sustainability in Israel and the Middle East. We will end the course with discussions regarding opportunities for global translation of innovative water technologies and water-management solutions developed in Israel to other water-poor regions. In addition, the course will host a symposium featuring international experts. It will explore how water access and control contributes to trans-boundary politics and how recent advances in Israeli water technologies may serve as a model for sustainable water development in other water-poor regions of the world.",

From their participation in the major socio-political movements of their day, including civil rights struggle , the Vietnam war, the New Left, the counterculture, and Neo-Conservativism, to more internal debates about politics, religion, assimilation, feminism, Israel, and social justice, the American Jewish 1960s was a turning point in the history of a community that was still finding its place in the United States.

    "ClassOverview": "This seminar examines the shifting place of Jews and Muslims in contemporary Spain. Together, we will explore several interrelated questions: (1) How have \"Spain\" and \"Europe\" variously been defined as modern, white, Christian, or secular by figuring Jews and Muslims as others? (2) How have these terms and the forms of life and history that they purport to represent changed over time? (3) What are the similarities and differences between the \"Jewish Question\" and the \"Muslim Problem\"? (4) How do Jews and Muslims understand themselves in relation to Spain, Europe, and to each other? At a time when racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and right-wing populist movements are ascendant in Spain and across Europe, we will work collaboratively to not only answer these questions, but to formulate new ones. To do so, we will consult scholarship in anthropology, history, cultural theory, and philosophy as well as fiction, film, and journalism as resources. Throughout the term, we will be especially attuned to the forms of inclusion and exclusion that have affected Jews and Muslims in Spain, always with an eye toward how such abstractions come to matter in everyday life.",

    "ClassOverview": "Jesus is certainly a central figure for Christianity and usually thought to mark decisive differences between it and Judaism: the idea of an embodied God is as alien to Judaism as the concept of trinity or the belief in a substitutionary sacrificial death. Considering this, it seems very remarkable that at a closer look, figurations of Jesus abound in Jewish literature. In the seminar we will concentrate on the realm of German language texts from the 18th century to the present dealing with Jesus or related symbols like the cross or scenes of the Passion and Crucifixion. Not surprisingly, in Christian as well as Jewish contexts mixing religious symbolism in literature and art repeatedly provoked scandals. Authors like Carl Einstein were fined for blaspheming Christ, while others like Stefan Zweig, Alfred D\u00f6blin and Franz Werfel were accused of having betrayed Judaism. One hypothesis concerning this corpus of texts is that by adopting central narratives and images of the Christian majority society they claim Jewish participation and explore its limits. By focusing on Jesus as a Jew many of these texts rewrite and transform dominant Christian perspectives and expose their inherent violence. If they present the martyred Jesus explicitly as a Jew e.g., connections to persecutions, pogroms and genocide are evoked. At the same time, questions concerning a shared history and modes of respect despite difference are raised. We will discuss how texts problematize assimilation and also try to understand the role of (trans-)figurations of Jesus in 20th Jewish literature about war, the Shoah and the modes of memory.",

Through exposure to and engagement with interdisciplinary research methods on law and legal processes, the course will provide students with a deeper understanding of law in its historical and social context.  The course will provide students with a set of research tools with which to conduct research on legal institutions.   The course builds on content from Legal Studies 206, a prerequisite for 207. While part of the Legal Studies major sequence, the course will enrich the analytic skills of students from many fields who are interested in law or in interdisciplinary research methods.  Prerequisite: LEGAL ST 206. Taught with SOCIOL 227; may not receive credit for both courses.The topical focus of the course will be violence by the police and capital punishment in the United States.  These topics will be explored with interdisciplinary readings and relevant legal cases.  Students will be exposed to several research tools and research processes, as they also engage with material on police violence and capital punishment.  In addition to shorter assignments, students will develop a small research project and write a research paper on a topic of their choosing.",

Many of us watch these shows to relax, to turn off our critical thinking, and to immerse ourselves wholly into some manufactured drama and schadenfreude.  Considered as a cultural text, though, reality television can illuminate some profound truths: about how we decide what is right and wrong, about the tension between written and unwritten rules, and whether anyone can simply be \"here to make friends.\"In this course, we ask what reality TV can teach us about the nature of law.  We'll read and discuss key works in the philosophy of law from H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Ronald Dworkin, Scott Shapiro, and others, and then see how their ideas stand up to the test of shows like Survivor, The Bachelor, FBoy Island, Ink Master, and Bachelor in Paradise.

We approach this difficult question by investigating what speakers know about how meaning is conveyed in language, including the distinction between what expressions literally mean, and the different shades of meaning that expressions can take on in different contexts of use. In carrying out this study, we plumb the linguist's toolkit (which includes tools borrowed from mathematics, logic, language acquisition, and experimental psychology) to discover how language scientists determine what a given word or sentence means, and whether that word or sentence means the same thing across occasions of use. This inquiry will lead the student to an understanding of the scientific study of language, by examining how it plays out in the domain of linguistic meaning. By the end of the course, students will have gained a deeper appreciation for one of the most important, yet still most elusive, aspects of the human capacity for language.",

Why do certain places come to signify past events and become sites of political conflict in the present? This class will address histories of state and intercommunal violence, how these histories are remembered and politicized today, and how they are reflected and negotiated through the material world. The course will begin with an introduction to questions of violence, memory, the politics of history, place, landscape, and monuments. It will continue by examining a variety of case studies from different geographical areas. The various examples and contexts will exemplify these themes of how violent pasts and the spaces and objects associated with them become sites of political contestation in the present. The class will then focus particularly on the example of Turkey as a case study through which to approach questions of memory, place, and histories of state violence against minority groups. We will examine in depth the case of the violent transformation of the Ottoman Empire into the contemporary Republic of Turkey with a focus on the 1915 Genocide of Ottoman Armenians and the ongoing war between the Turkish state and the Kurdish minority, in the context of a long history of state violence against minority communities. Throughout the course students will engage with various and competing narratives of histories of violence, including state denial, memories of survivors, and attempts to resurrect the memories of repressed events. Students will engage with theoretical debates relating to memory, state violence, materiality, and space and place, and will design an individual research project relating to the themes of the course.",

Together, we will explore several interrelated questions: (1) How have \"Spain\" and \"Europe\" variously been defined as modern, white, Christian, or secular by figuring Jews and Muslims as others? (2) How have these terms and the forms of life and history that they purport to represent changed over time? (3) What are the similarities and differences between the \"Jewish Question\" and the \"Muslim Problem\"? (4) How do Jews and Muslims understand themselves in relation to Spain, Europe, and to each other? At a time when racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and right-wing populist movements are ascendant in Spain and across Europe, we will work collaboratively to not only answer these questions, but to formulate new ones. To do so, we will consult scholarship in anthropology, history, cultural theory, and philosophy as well as on fiction, film, and journalism as resources. Throughout the term, we will be especially attuned to the forms of inclusion and exclusion that have affected Jews and Muslims in Spain, always with an eye toward how such abstractions come to matter in everyday life.",

This, in turn, will allow us to understand how reframing the same archival items can shift how people search and read records.For example, in the collections from Burj al-Shamali camp, Yasmine Eid-Sabbagh has over many years tried to give disembodied layers the same status as the material layers of photographs in order to addressthe emotional dimensions of trauma, silence, refusal, resistance and other affects unleashed by these photographs.Looking at the  AIF's Armenian collections will enable an investigation into how dispossession and perpetual migration have defined the presence and absence of Armenians in Ottoman landscapes and how varied methods of documentation might intervene in these historic and contemporary landscapes.The sessions, articulated through lectures, practice-based workshops, and public events, will be led by three members of the current Board of Directors of the AIF: Vartan Avakian, Yasmine Eid-Sabbagh and KristineKhouri.Participants will learn, explore, and generate new knowledge by working on collections from the Arab Image Foundation and related projects.",

With special emphasis on the genealogies, practices, and problematics of Arabic literary modernity, this course will introduce students to the major works of Arabic literature produced in the nineteenth and early twentieth century and to the major debates, social changes, and material developments that attend the period, including (but not limited to) language reform, migration, print capitalism, imperialism, and nationalism. In short, we will try to understand how these authors, through their texts, both produced and theorized modernity for their readers in the localized contexts of Imperial influence and control on the one hand, and the global-though uneven-nineteenth-century processes of social, political, economic, and technological change.",

    "ClassOverview": "This is a project-based laboratory to investigate the genetic roots of neurobiology and behavior in a simple model system. We will study neural circuits and behavior using mutant analysis, neuroanatomical techniques, and behavioral paradigms such as courtship, aggression, and circadian and sleep behavior. We will use the fruit fly as a model system because of the amazing genetic tools available to study the fly nervous system and the conservation of basic neurobiological processes between flies and humans. During the first section of the course you will learn a variety of techniques through assigned projects. You will then design a project using the techniques learned in class, to be completed in the final weeks of the course. This will be summarized in a lab report due during finals week.NOTE 1:This course requires manual dexterity, steady hands, and good vision. You will need to handle flies while keeping them healthy, dissect their brain tissue, and troubleshoot practical problems. If any of these might pose extraordinary challenges for you, please talk to the instructor before registering.NOTE 2: You will need to come into the labs outside class time at least a few times a week to collect virgin flies. This is done at the beginning (before 9:15 am) and the end of the day and it is an ongoing task. Later in the course you likely also will need to come to finish experiments. Time outside regularly scheduled class is typically 2 or more hours per week, scheduled to our mutual convenience, and motivated students often elect to spend more time. Prerequisites: NEUROSCI 202-0 and NEUROSCI 206-0; or NEUROSCI 311-0 and NEUROSCI 206-0; or BIOL SCI 302-0.",

We will discuss how \"nature\" (the genetic makeup) and \"nurture\" contribute to shape individual behavior and explore the implications of this interaction at the level of society, from philosophical and ethical aspects to medical and legal considerations. We will often follow a historical perspective to understand how our thinking on this subject has changed with the advancement of scientific knowledge and with the evolution of what we think is acceptable in society.The class content will be strongly anchored in basic science: we will first learn concepts of both classical and modern genetics and neurogenetics (with emphasis on human genetics). We will then talk about how genes can determine or influence behavior: we will discuss how genes build neural circuits and how brain circuits in turn produce behavior (often using animal models as examples). Starting from primary research and reviews, students will be asked to discuss relevant topics in this area including the genetics of aggression, parental behavior, social behavior, predisposition to mental illness or disease etc.Assessment will be based on a combination of quizzes, in class presentations and a final essay based on original literature research. This is an upper-level course where you will utilize a lot of what you have learned in the past few years: molecular biology, intro neuroscience, anatomy, physiology...",

What value does privacy have, and how do surveillance and big data change our experience of privacy? Does social media make political discourse irrational? What impact does it have on social movements? What ethical questions do technologies like algorithms and virtual reality raise?

Who ought to rule politically and why? When is the exercise of power legitimate and when is it illegitimate? Does a distinctive form of power arise in modern societies? How do unjust or pathological power relations arise, and what are their corrosive effects on individuals and entire societies? In this course we will explore these  questions by reading central texts in the history of political philosophy. After examining different answers to the question who should rule, we turn to the efforts of critical theorists to expose invisible workings of power, and the philosophical confrontation with the rise of 20th-century totalitarianism. Readings may include Plato, Hobbes, Rousseau, Arendt, Schmitt, and Foucault.",

We will critically compare and appraise the different  methodologies, aims, concepts of power, and interpretive politics within these analyses of sexuality and/or the family  as contingent formations. We will  give attention to several recent publications  by the philosophers under consideration that  have  prompted contemporary revision of established interpretations of these bodies of work. And we will ask how the work of Beauvoir, Fanon, Foucault and Castro-G\u00f3mez continues to be resituated today within  a number of fields including  contemporary critical theory, decolonial theory, critical race studies,  and gender and sexualities studies. We will ask: what new concepts have now emerged from these transits and translations of mid twentieth-century theory?",

We'll also critically examine more contemporary trends and debates in social/political philosophy of language, likely including applications of speech act theory, the at-issue/not-at-issue distinction, the ideal/non-ideal distinction as applied to the philosophy of language, and the idea of an ``ameliorative\" approach to linguistic analysis.",

We will explore wave models of sound and light and associated phenomena such as refraction, Doppler shift, and interference. We will discuss the quantum version of wave theory and the ensuing wave-particle duality. The revolutions of quantum mechanics and relativity shook the foundations of physics and led to a rethinking of physical laws. We will investigate the theoretical underpinnings and applications of the new physics. Demonstrations and discussions of historical experiments will be used to illustrate how we know what we know about the universe.",

    "ClassOverview": "It is reasonable to assume that most of us owe (or will at some point owe) money to creditors from whom we've borrowed funds. Debt is pervasive in the United States: many people have outstanding debts in the form of student loans, credit card bills, open lines of credit with banks, or home mortgages. The U.S. government has also built up an impressively large debt load over the past sixty years (over $13 trillion before the March 2020 eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic). But while debt touches most people's lives in some fashion, the complex history and politics of modern debtor-lender relations remains, for most, essentially unknown territory. The central purpose of this course, then, is to deepen our understanding of how we got to this point. How did debt - both private and public - swell to current levels? How were markets for debt built? What were the politics of some key turning points in the history of debt? How did differences in the terms of access to credit produce and reinforce social inequalities? When do debt markets break down and how do societies recover from debt crises? Under what conditions are debts honored and when can (and should) debt contracts be repudiated?",

    "ClassOverview": "The Supreme Court has come to play an increasingly controversial role in American politics. On the heels of the conservative legal movement, the Court has reshaped important policy domains including voting rights, campaign finance regulation, and gun control. In response, liberal backlash has emerged with influential policymakers calling for reform\u2014ranging from term limits to adding additional seats to the Court to dilute conservative influence. All the while, the nomination and confirmation process has become extremely contentious: Senate Republicans refused to consider President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland in 2016 and Senate Democrats invoked the filibuster in a failed attempt to block President Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch a year later. In this course, students will examine the politics of the modern U.S. Supreme Court. Using a combination of academic scholarship, journalism, and legal documents, students will consider important questions of what influences judicial decisionmaking, how the Court became dominated by conservative jurists, whether the Court's jurisprudence really \"matters\", and if the Court advances or hinder American democracy. Although we will read a handful of legal documents, this course will not be a constitutional law class per se. Rather than focusing on the legal reasoning of the justices (as you would in constitutional law) we will examine the Court within the broader political system. Students will also sharpen their ability to think critically, collect evidence, present an argument, and join others in a collective inquiry. Most importantly, perhaps, students will be expected to engage constructively with one another throughout the course as we work together to improve our understanding of the Supreme Court and American government writ large.",

We also will examine Blacks' fraught relations with whites, their engagement with mainstream political institutions, and their efforts to secure their rights and advance their interests from within and outside these institutions at the national and local level. The course materials cover a mix of topics that have occupied students of race and American politics since the Civil Rights Movement. These include: ongoing intergroup conflict and prejudice; segregation; social provision and criminal justice policies; systemic anti-Black racism in law enforcement; racial dynamics in voting and access to the ballot; partisan politics; and Blacks' electoral fortunes, including the election of the country's first Black president and the ensuing political developments.

    "ClassOverview": "This is a critical time for market globalization. In the past decade and a half, many countries' financial systems have experienced profoundly destabilizing shocks. The global distribution of economic and political power is shifting. Policymakers in the United States and elsewhere have grown increasingly skeptical of the efficacy and fairness of the international organizations charged with governing globalized markets. A nationalist-populist tide swept into the political scene in many countries in recent years. And, of course, the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global diffusion of lockdowns to control the spread of the virus, and the attendant severe, synchronized economic downturns provoked many prominent observers, including the newly-appointed Chief Economist of the World Bank, Carmen Reinhart, to wonder if the pandemic is the \"last nail in the coffin of globalization.\" This course is intended to take stock of market globalization in light of these integrating and fragmenting forces. What is market globalization? Are its effects on the economic fortunes of individuals and groups in historically rich countries different than the effects in developing countries? Has market globalization gone too far - or has it not gone far enough? These are the kinds of questions that will be discussed in the course. The course is organized around five main topics: (1) conceptualizing market globalization; (2) describing transformations in the constituent parts of market globalization (international trade, globalized production, finance, and labor migration); (3) exploring how different national styles of capitalism in the historically rich Northern countries have adjusted to pressures generated by \"deeper\" forms of market globalization; (4) the relationship between market globalization, economic development, and global inequality; (5) exploring the challenges to globalization posed by the recent rise of nationalist-populist ideologies in many countries and the fragmenting effects of the COVID-19 public health crisis and global economic downturn.",

How to explain the large variation within Africa in the strength of the state, the levels of economic growth and respect for democratic institutions? What role identities (ethnic, religious and gender) play out in politics? What are the current dilemmas and questions in African politics? The course is organized around the following broad themes: the formation of the state in Africa; the practice of power, regimes types and forms of government, the role of religion, identity and politics; the challenges of development and the economic dimensions of African politics; authoritarianism and democratic experiments; elections; protests and social movements; violence, terror, and security; Africa in world politics.

We were arriving at the 'end point' of political evolution where democracy would henceforth be the only legitimate game in town throughout the world. Today a more sober view prevails. Authoritarianism has proven a resilient force, and regressions from democracy back to authoritarianism, often with mass political support, seem to be the new trend. The focus of this course is on problems of democratic regimes. We will examine debates about the meaning of democracy, how authoritarian regimes are transformed into democratic regimes, and how these survive, fall, or decay. We will also question the dichotomy between \"democracy\" and \"authoritarianism\" as we examine how they often coexist in stable ways and authoritarianism is exercised through democratic institutions.",

The answer is, yes, it does matter and there is a difference; in aims, planning, execution, results, and final resolution including justice. Genocide targets a predetermined population with the aim of elimination in entirety, every living member from seniors to babies not merely a military victory. In this class we will look at the largely modern phenomenon of genocide (including its limited subset, ethnic cleansing) focusing on the Holocaust, Bosnia, and Rwanda. We will also look briefly at today's world. The class will investigate the instances of specificity versus comparability so as not to take anything away from a particular case on the one hand but to be social scientists on the other. A goal of this class is to identify structures and triggers which have and could lead a society down this path and what obstacles can be placed in the past, In other words, where do we find the major prompts, causes, triggers and turning points.",

    "ClassOverview": "Special Topics: Integrity and the Politics of CorruptionIf all seasoned politicians in a fragile democracy are implicated in wide-scale corruption, but if the country is facing an acute economic crisis requiring experience at the helm, what ought to be done about the corrupt, and who ought to decide? What compromises, if any, are appropriate when considering kleptocrats who are effectively holding their people hostage - for instance, rulers who systematically abuse loans from foreign creditors, but who rely on the fact that their vulnerable population will suffer if loans are cut off entirely? What compromises, if any, are morally appropriate when dealing with dictators who threaten to unleash violence unless they are guaranteed an amnesty by the democratic forces trying to replace them? This upper-level course delves into such fraught political problems, revolving around different kinds of corruption and abuse of political power. In order to grapple with these problems, we examine in detail two moral ideas related to \"the people.\" The first is the idea of the sovereign people as the owner of public property, often stolen by corrupt politicians. The second is the idea of the people as an agent with its own moral integrity - an integrity that might bear on intricate policy dilemmas surrounding the proper response to corruption. In the process of examining both of these ideas, students will acquire familiarity with prominent philosophical treatments of integrity, property, and - more generally - public policy.",

In 2008 America elected its first African American President, Barack Obama and reelected him in 2012.This class will examine presidential elections and how they have evolved since 1952 the first year TV advertising began to have an impact on the races. This class will challenge some of the myths about elections and their outcomes. We will also examine the 2008 campaign, which was dubbed the \"YouTube\" election and was historic by virtue of its outcome, the candidates who ran and the impact the Internet and new technologies had on the race. In 2012 the Obama campaign had the most intense \"ground game\" of any campaign in history, we will examine how the campaign succeeded in this effort. In 2016 Donald Trump bypassed typical advertising methods of reaching voters by unleashing a torrent of Twitter messages, and finding a willing press that was, at least in the primaries, willing to give him uncritical or challenging coverage.",

    "ClassOverview": "Machiavelli is a fascinating figure. As widely as he has been read for more than five centuries\u2014his major works have never been out of print\u2014he evades simple characterization. For example, the ends justify the means. So what? Which ends? What means? And, do they really, all ends and all means? Certainly not, though his chosen protagonists will leave you wondering. Famously, one of his major works is in defense of republics, another is an equally forceful support of principalities. Contradictory? Are there any threads that run through all of his works? What motivated Machiavelli? I will take a position (and in fact, having set up this class the way I did, I already have) and so will you. We are going to read works by Machiavelli rather than about Machiavelli: a variety of different genres, diplomatic briefs, his most famous treatises, a comedic play, and some memoranda. In all of these pieces of writing there is more than meets the eye so in no way should you think of these primary-source documents as mere \"information.\" That we find Machiavelli clear and forthright has more to do with his nearly single-handed revolution in political philosophy than any simplicity in his works. In short, after Machiavelli, we all look at the world in the terms that he laid down. The text, the subtext, the context, and everything in between those lines is important to understand Machiavelli. In many ways Machiavelli is a vehicle for what I hope we can accomplish this term, namely, to introduce you to a scholarly community. I hope to introduce you to how scholars read, how scholars think, the ambiguities that cause us confusion, the questions that pique our curiosity, to give you a rich experience with how scholars write, and finally, how to ask and try to answer scholarly questions. Along the way we will sample some of Machiavelli's insights, analytical leaps, and carnivalesque humor to appraise the founder of Political Science as we know it, the figure who many see as the founder of modernity itself.",

    "ClassOverview": "Contemporary Political Thought: Hannah ArendtHannah Arendt (1906-1975) rejected references to herself as a \"political philosopher\" by insisting that her purpose in thinking and writing was to \"look at politics \u2026 with eyes unclouded by philosophy.\" In approaching Arendt's writings in terms that she uniquely designated as \"political theory,\" this seminar's theoretical orientation begins from a perspective that places her influential understanding of \"politics\" first, exploring a complex of perplexities in late modernity central to her warning to \"think what we are doing.\" The seminar's textual and interpretive orientation is comprehensive, covering a wide range of Arendt's essays and articles on freedom, authority, the concept of history, tradition and modernity in western political thought, refugees, statelessness, violence, civil disobedience, moral responsibility, political judgment, and truth and lying in politics, while structured around three influential books still pertinent to what she called \"the burden of our time\": The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951); The Human Condition (1958); and On Revolution (1963), as well as her incendiary exploration of the \"banality of evil\" in the controversial Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963). Although we will be mainly concerned with primary texts, establishing fluency and understanding of a range of Arendt's works, secondary sources in Arendt studies will also be integral to the syllabus and seminar discussion and allowed for inclusion in the final paper. The seminar should give you graduate-level expertise in Arendt's political theory and enable you to bring her writings to bear upon a wide range of historical and contemporary, global and national, problems of politics in late modernity.",

What is \"modern\" about Islamic revivalism and how does it shape Islamic activism? How did Islamic political thought evolve and adapt to changing political circumstances within Muslim societies in an increasingly globalized world? We draw from intellectual history, comparative politics and political theory to examine some of the major ideological currents, political movements and intellectual figures who sought, since the end of the late 19th century, to reconstruct the political and social dimensions of Muslim societies and countries along Islamic lines. The course focuses on the intellectual origins of the resurgence and spread of \"political Islam\". Our readings include primary sources in translation as well as secondary sources from history, Islamic studies, political science, and anthropology. Topics include: decline and revival, Islamic reform, Islam and modernity, rationality, ijtihad (Islamic legal independent reasoning), Shura (deliberative decision- making), Muslim unity, pan-Islamism, Secularism, Sharia, Caliphate, Fundamentalism, Islamic state, Democracy, Islam and the West, Gender (in) equality, Liberal Islam, Human rights, Violence, Jihad.",

We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, and official categorization to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy, classification systems, and citizenship? How have movements and counter-movements around the transformation of gender developed, and how have gendered divides influenced politics of all sorts? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include grassroots democratic activism, the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as examining formal politics and policies. We will read and discuss scholars drawing on diverse theoretical and methodological traditions, and we engage with analyses of a variety of contexts across the world (the US, other rich capitalist democracies, postcolonial states and beyond), striving to situate states and political mobilization in global contexts.

In order to do so, we will first study the development of realism in literature throughout the 20th century. Although we will pay some attention to film techniques, our major concern will be with narrative strategies, ideological content and the ethics of representation.

    "ClassOverview": "The goal of this course is to study how people come to be the unique individuals that they are. We will begin at the very beginning of life and learn the biological and environmental influences that help to shape people's personalities over time. We will look at the basic building blocks of temperament and how they these fundamental characteristics of children develop into the major personality characteristics of adults. We will seek to answer questions about what motivates us, how we manage our emotions internally and in social settings, and how we interact as social beings. We will also look at ways in which personality traits may be stable over time or may be susceptible to change. Finally, we will examine the relation between personality and mental health. In what ways do different personality characteristics predispose us to or protect us from the development of psychopathology? What does it mean to have a disordered personality?In this course, we will use both a book that will serve as our primary text and additional required articles that will include research and theoretical articles. Both sources of reading will be critical for understanding this course and (especially information from the book) will not be fully covered in lectures. The research articles may be challenging if you have never read a psychology article before, and I will go over what you need to know and allow time for questions about these articles in class. Class will also cover material that is not explicitly in the readings and will include examples and discussions that will be instrumental to your ability to master the material. If you do not attend class regularly, you should expect that the exams will probably be very challenging for you.",

Why is beauty associated with femininity? What cultural biases help those perceived as beautiful and hurt those perceived as lacking in beauty? Are beautiful people happier or more successful?

In other words, we will examine the phenomena and processes associated with one's beliefs about members of social groups (stereotypes), attitudes and evaluative responses toward group members (prejudice), and behaviors toward members of a social group based on their group membership (discrimination).  Also, we will study how these issues shape the experiences of social group members, especially when they are members of low-status and/or minority groups.  In order to explore these topics, we will primarily focus on large societal groups that differ on dimensions of identity such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and religion.  Rather than relying on anecdotal evidence, cultural truisms, or philosophical orientations to address these issues, we will approach these issues wearing the hat of an experimental social psychologist.  That is, we will examine traditional and contemporary theories of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, punctuated by empirical findings.  Finally, we will apply the theoretical and empirical work to current events and issues.",

Is it true that money can't buy it? What brings about happiness\u2014sensory pleasures? A sense of purpose? Success? Good genes? Determination? Spiritual fulfilment? Is happiness an inner quality that sparks through us mysteriously, or is it a trainable skill that we can cultivate through step-by-step behavior modifications? What does it mean to study happiness using the tools of science, philosophy, history, literature, and religious studies? This course will explore these questions and more through sampling snippets from the enormous and growing field of happiness studies that has emerged in the past few decades out of a variety of academic disciplines, especially positive psychology, as well as critiques of these studies. Course materials will be interdisciplinary and broad in scope, not promoting any one approach, technique, or interpretation of happiness as the \"right\" one. Students will consider a variety of viewpoints on the promises and pitfalls of happiness through reading an array of leading thinkers including The Dalai Lama, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Sarah Ahmed, Matthieu Ricard, and many others, with an eye toward encouraging students to find their own way in this rich conversation about what makes a good life.",

Mindfulness is also being presented as a panacea for those suffering from physical and mental pain, readily available in American hospital settings and psychological counseling services. Buddha images too can be found far from Buddhist temples\u2014at the hip restaurant Buddha-Bar located in many cities around the world one can sip cocktails and dine before a massive Buddha statue while listening to lounge music. And in the Chicago area, one encounters Buddha head sculptures positioned on the ground in parks, by roads, and even in public school playgrounds as part of the Ten Thousand Ripples art project.How, and why, did aspects of Buddhism enter all of these different social locations?  Why does Buddhism receive a pass more often than other religions by the \"spiritual but not religious\" crowd? Can Buddhism be secular? In what ways is Buddhism compatible with science, and can Buddhist practices be proven effective using scientific methods? Can paying better attention by means of Buddhist meditation practices liberate us from suffering caused by digital distraction? In what ways can Buddhist articulations of interdependence, no self, and compassion be resources for addressing racial and structural injustice, even as sexual abuse, racism, and trans/homophobia continue to traumatize members of some Buddhist communities?

In the course of this exploration, we seek to challenge our presuppositions about a seemingly simple question: what is \"the body,\" and how do we know? We open by considering themes of dying and the afterlife, food and drink, health and medicine, gender and family. We then turn to Daoist traditions of visual culture that envision the human body as intimately connected with the cosmos and picture the body's interior as a miniature landscape populated by a pantheon of gods. We read ghost stories and analyze the complex history of footbinding. Finally, we conclude with two case studies of religion and the body in contemporary China, one situated on the southwestern periphery, the other in the capital city of Beijing. Throughout the quarter, we investigate how the body has mediated relationships between Buddhist, Daoist, and popular religious traditions. By the course's end, students will gain key resources for understanding historical and contemporary Chinese culture, and new perspectives on what it means to be religious and embodied.",

    "ClassOverview": "This course is designed as an introductory survey of Jewish religion and culture during the modern period, from the perspective of Jewish \"revolutionaries\" - individuals and movements - that sparked radical change and transformation.  Throughout, we will be reading a variety of genres - a play, short stories, works of philosophy, political documents, and works of theology.  We open with a reading of The Merchant of Venice to examine the economic role of Jews in medieval and post-Renaissance Europe, Christian understandings of Judaism, the expulsion of the Jews from England and other countries in Europe, the creation of Jewish ghettos, Jewish cultural and religious responses to ghettoization, Jewish conversions to Christianity and Islam, the rise of the Marranos and D\u00f6nmeh and their migrations, and the perceptions of Jews spawned as a consequence, as well as Jewish self-perceptions.We begin by investigating various aspects of what constitutes varieties of the \"modern\" in Jewish experiences in different parts of the world, including Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and the United States, and we will also examine a variety of historiographical debates on the topic, ranging in their interpretations from the impact of 1492 to the Marrano experience of hiding one's Jewish identity to the Frankist and Sabbatian challenges to Jewish rabbinic authority as well as conversion to Islam and to Christianity. The course will look at the transformation of the economic and political roles played by Jews in modern times and their impact on Jewish religious practices and beliefs, the struggle for emancipation, the rise of antisemitism, and debates among Jews over assimilation versus Zionism. Constructions of \"modern\" Jewish identity and religious expressions will be studied in relation to the emergence of both Reform Judaism and Hasidism, and by examining differences between the Judaism constructed in Christian Europe and the Judaism constructed in Islamic regions.The course will also examine the crucial developments of the twentieth century, including mass migration to the United States, the Zionist movement, the Russian revolution, the Holocaust, post-WWII recovery and the establishment of the State of Israel. The differing impact of these movements on men and women will be examined.",

    "ClassOverview": "What, or rather who, is Israel? This course explores the name \"Israel\" as it marks place, an identity, and a claim to belong. We examine its history, from the earliest appearances of the name in the archaeological record of ancient West Asia to the complex politics of the modern Middle East, and its significance for three groups to whose identity the claim to be Israel is fundamental: Jews, Samaritans, and Christians. In the process, we engage head-on with how people differentiate themselves from one another by means of a common past. How do you know you have a collective identity? And what happens when people with whom you don't identify claim to have that identity as well - or instead - of you?",

    "ClassOverview": "The central question of this course is: What Makes a Difference? Analyzing a variety of works of media addressing environmental themes, including works drawn from advertising and marketing, we will consider different types of environmental messaging and attempts to mobilize public moral engagement. Specifically, we will be looking at strategies for implementing media interventions as moral interventions. Discussion taken up in this class will include evaluating the comparative value of media messaging that emphasizes individual action and personal responsibility, versus messaging that promotes collective action, policy, and structural changes. Students will consider and debate what constitutes authentic \"green\" messaging versus mere corporate \"greenwashing.\" Throughout, we will ask what kind of media we need in what has been called the \"Anthropocene\" (a time when humans are now a major geologic force affecting the future of the planet). When motivating public moral engagement in climate crisis, are the solutions being offered those that the planet will actually \"register\" or \"notice\" on a global scale? If not, what kinds of \"media interventions\" do we need to be making and how? Course content will include discussion of media interventions as moral interventions, media activism for social change, eco-media responses by religious communities and organizations, participatory digital culture, and the challenges of addressing environmental crisis in the distraction economy and what has been called the \"post-truth era.\" Students will have the opportunity to learn by doing, proposing and crafting their own environmental media interventions as the course's final project. This course is about taking action and making a true difference.  [Format: lecture/seminar/discussion hybrid combination]",

    "ClassOverview": "This course explores feminist religion and spirituality as a locus of care, community, reflection, ritual, and cultural memory. Feminist studies of religion have frequently assumed a secular framework that sees religion as a barrier to liberation. However, many feminists have issued transformative critiques of patriarchal authority from within religious institutions. Others have left their religious communities behind to forge new spiritual definitions and practices. This class incorporates these approaches through readings in feminist theory, theology, and popular media such as memoirs, manifestos, and zines. The class centers BIPOC, lesbian, and trans feminist voices, with particular attention to the works of Gloria E. Anzald\u00faa and Audre Lorde.",

Drawing upon foundational and newer works in the field, we will explore how the construction of these categories, rooted in biological essentialism, has had immense consequences for the enslaved and her descendants, indigenous peoples, other people of color, and women, queer, transgender, and gender-nonconforming individuals. The historical record shows that individuals born cisgender male and socialized as men, namely white heterosexual men, have historically and contemporaneously dominated and controlled the North Americas and the globe. They have upheld their hegemonic and institutional power by wielding the social constructions of \"gender\" and \"sexuality\" to their benefit, often using religion, and specifically white Christianities, biblical fundamentalism, and \"religio-racial race making\" to regulate sexual bodies gendered and understood as non-white and non-man. This course examines the interconnected histories of race, sexuality and religion in the Americas through the vantage point of African American Studies, and specifically Black Queer Studies, and charts the construction of these categories and how racialized people\u2014both within and beyond religious institutions\u2014have resisted and challenged their centrality.",

Readings are drawn from international politics, religious studies, political theory, law, anthropology, and history.With the support of a curricular linkage program, the International Classroom Partnering Grant, supported by the Office of International Relations, we will be in conversation about the politics of religion and race in transnational perspective with colleagues at Sciences Po (Paris) and the University of Toronto (Institute of Islamic Studies).

Poland's shifting borders and the complex history and politics they represent provide a unique point of entry into modern European history.  In this course, we will explore the distinctive ways in which history and culture combine in a colonized nation at Europe's heart by way of novels, films, essays, memoirs, journalism, and poetry.  Authors to be read will include Nobel Laureates Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, Wis\u0142awa Szymborska, and Olga Tokarczuk.",

This course offers a first part of the survey of the main trends in Russian poetry, which is dedicated to 19th-century Russian Poetry. Precisely in the 19th century, Russian poetry had become a kind of national symbol due to the works of Zhukovsky, Pushkin, Baratynsky, Lermontov, Tiutchev, and others. Although the topics of this so-called Golden Age of Russian literature were many, particular emphasis was on the genre of elegy. The Russian elegy is a kind of \"the glass bead game,\" if we use this title of Hesse's novel, that each of the Russian poets tried to add with his own brilliance, not with just sorrow and tears. To find out how brilliance and approach were different in each particular case, is one of the intellectual adventures that this course offers.",

It will look at the factors leading to the USSR's disintegration and resulting ethnic conflicts, the security issues requiring responses from the U.S., and the decision-making processes in responding to these challenges.The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the twentieth century's last in a series of collapses of multinational empires, and it presented the U.S. with the most difficult security challenges.   In the immediate aftermath, U.S. policy makers were faced with not one but four nuclear powers (Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus), thousands of under-secured nuclear weapons and under-paid nuclear scientists, and several armed secessionist conflicts in the Caucasus and Moldova.The collapse of the USSR meant the end of an uneasy, but by and large consensual, international security system. Russia has shown a willingness to reject that consensus. It has rejected Western support for the democratic aspirations of former Soviet states, willing even to use military force to deny countries like Ukraine and Georgia their sovereign rights to join NATO and the EU. Closer to home, it has employed various direct and indirect efforts to undermine Western solidarity and confidence in the liberal democratic system.",

We focus on the ways the images and metaphors have been used as carriers of cultural value and ideological meaning, exploring such issues as word and image, gender and nationality, aesthetics and psychology, politics and propaganda. Since the course topic involves such disciplines as visual art, literature, cultural theory, and philosophy, readings include modern and contemporary aesthetic theories (Shklovsky, Gyorgy Lukacs, Boris Groys) and twentieth-century political and ethical philosophy (Gramsci, Ortega-i-Gasset, Walter Benjamin et al.), and psychology (Freud, Edward Bernays).",

    "ClassOverview": "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in an ideal world?Utopian thought has a long history in Western thought as different writers have attempted to define the ideal community from Plato's Republic through to Thomas More \u2018s first coining of \"Utopia\" as an ideal community in the Sixteenth century. Utopias were often defined as counter critiques of existing social arrangements and at times people actually attempted to create and live in \"intentional communities\" based on their ideals. In this seminar we will explore fictional and real utopian communities in different historical periods\u2026 such as preindustrial agricultural religious settlements (for example the Amish or Oneida), planned industrial communities (the factory town of Pullman in Chicago) and anti-and post-industrial communities (the Walden II \"hippy\" commune Twin Oaks emerging out of the 60s). We will use these and other cases as critical analyses of existing societies highlighting the social problems of their day\u2026issues such as inequalities of wealth and power, individual versus collective priorities, changing family structure, sexual relations and gender roles, defining and dealing with deviants, and institutions like governance, education, work and leisure. We will explore in detail the founding, the dynamics, and the fates of attempts to live in real utopian communities. We will conclude with a consideration of the role of utopian thought in contemporary society for example the role of digital technology and smart cities in addressing climate change. We will also make use of Chicagoland as a setting to explore utopian thought and communities from the Burnham Master Plan for the City of Chicago itself to Olmsted's planned suburb of Riverdale to the religious community of Zion.",

In this section, we will also conceptually examine the roles of policymakers, social advocates, and the media in the process of defining social problems.

Why do most administrative forms only have two categories (i.e. Male and Female)? Why do male doctors, on average, have higher incomes than female doctors?  The course introduces students to the sociological analysis of gender as a central component of social organization and social inequality in the US context.  We start by reviewing key sociological concepts that are important to the study of gender.  Next, we explore the causes and consequences of gender inequalities in important social institutions such as the family, the education system, and the labor market. We conclude by considering gender inequality in an international comparative context to understand crosscutting similarities and differences between the US and both high- and low-income contexts.

The course will often focus on survey data, but the techniques covered apply broadly to empirical data. Survey data, specifically that derived from the General Social Survey (GSS), will provide the examples for class discussion and the foundation for the final exam. By the end of the course, students will be able to read and interpret research and perform analyses using empirical data. These skills are applicable beyond the conduct of sociological research and will enable students to critically evaluate information not only from the academic realm but from news articles and the world around them. The critical, analytical, and numerical skills developed in this course are valuable ones to have regardless of major or post-graduation plans.Nearly all analysis in the course will be done using the statistical software \"Stata\".

A total of eight technologies will serve as the exemplars through which the question(s) concerning technology will be explored: bicycles, cars, computers, facial recognition, genetic sequencing, soap, shipping containers and virtual reality. Each of these technologies is approached as a window into the social, political, racial, and economic determinants of technological innovation. The central goal of the course is to equip students with the tools for unpacking the technologies societies take for granted and critically engaging with new technologies that may reproduce social inequities.

From there, students will be introduced to new developments in social scientists' understanding of how gangs operate, as well as accounts of how other groups in society have responded to gangs. Readings will combine both theory and empirical description, preparing students to engage with tough questions like how globalization and the internet have changed the way that gangs operate, or how the topic of gangs intersects with groups like Black Lives Matter, or calls to defund the police.

Whether or not you get a job, who will date or marry, whether or not you'll catch a contagious disease are all affected by the social networks in which you live. This class explores the ways our social networks shape society, and how society shapes our social networks.Social Network Analysis (SNA) refers to both a theoretical perspective and a set of methodological techniques.  As a theoretical perspective, SNA stresses the interdependence among social actors.  This approach views the social world as patterns or regularities in relationships among interacting units and focuses on how such patterns affect the behavior of network units or actors.  A \"structure\" emerges as a persistent pattern of interaction that can influence a multitude of behaviors, such as getting a job, income attainment, political decision making, social revolutions, organizational merges, global finance and trade markets, delinquent youth behaviors, the spread of infectious diseases, and so on.  As a methodological approach, SNA refers to a catalog of techniques steeped in mathematical graph theory and now extending to statistical simulation, and algebraic models.  This course surveys the growing field of SNA, emphasizing the merger of theory and method, while gaining hands on experience with network data and software. As such, the course is designed to be (roughly) equal parts theory and methods. Students will leave the course with the ability to understand and apply SNA in a variety of contexts.",

One such problem may inquire, \"what if industry x continues to grow at the same rate?\" Another may ask, \"what if blacks and whites had the same educational distributions?\" And a third perhaps wonders, \"what if you found yourself in an iterated prisoner's dilemma fighting for your life?\" Social simulations are super fancy what if problems that use a mix of math and computational code to answer a complex of important questions. This course is an introduction to a variety of what if problems and the flexible set of methods that can be used to answer the related questions.The course begins by exploring simulations of populations and their dynamics\u2014collectively called demographic methods. Using a simple set of empirical parameters, students will learn to simulate changes in population size and composition, as well as the formal demographic processes of fertility, mortality and migration. In this section, the what if problems center on the role of population parameters in producing both aggregate outcomes and individualized measures such as life expectancy and total fertility rate. After covering the demographic simulations, the focus turns to agentic simulations (i.e., agent-based models), where, in addition to encountering fixed population parameters, the artificially simulated and independent agents employ specific strategies. The what if questions for this part of the course center on the role of individual strategies in shaping population outcomes. During this portion, students will learn to create and analyze basic agentic simulations of large, complex social behaviors such as segregation and cooperation.At the heart of all the methods covered in the course is a particular way of looking at the world, simultaneously from the top down and the bottom up. The course aim is to introduce students to the mix of methodological tools for social simulation and the nuanced theoretical perspective that their use entails. Students will learn and apply these techniques through a series of weekly problems sets performed in either Excel or NetLogo.",

    "ClassOverview": "\"Indigeneity and Settler Colonialism\"In this seminar, we examine settler colonialism as a political, social, cultural and economic formation, and Indigenous resistance, resilience and resurgence, focusing on the US in historical, comparative and global perspective. Settler colonialism is a distinctive form of social organization, which emerges within a global context of empires and colonial domination of peoples of the Americas, Africa, Oceania and Asia by Europeans and their descendants, in which settlers \"come to stay\" (Veracini 2010) and seek replacement of indigenous peoples, rather than the extraction and transfer of wealth to the \"home\" country (Bacon and Norton 2019). It is a constituent part of modernity. As Glenn (2015) has argued: \"The settler goal of seizing and establishing property rights over land and resources required the removal of indigenes, which was accomplished by various forms of direct and indirect violence, including militarized genocide. Settlers sought to control space, resources, and people not only by occupying land but also by establishing an exclusionary private property regime and coercive labor systems.\" We need increased recognition of Indigenous values, worldviews, and lifeways, as much sociological work omits the Indigenous perspective, and consequently sociological explanations are often ill-fitting or insufficient in understanding the \"fourth world\" of Native nations and their relations with settler societies. Notably, we seek to engage with analyses of inequality, power and difference that reflect the distinctive Indigenous experience within US settler colonialism: \"Native peoples were colonized and deposed of their territories as distinct peoples - hundreds of nations - not as a racial or ethnic group\u2026\"  (Dunbar-Ortiz 2014, p.xiii). The readings are multidisciplinary - covering sociology, Native studies, other social sciences and history, and we incorporate the works of diverse Indigenous scholars, philosophers and thought leaders. Topics covered include: indigenous perspectives on time, power and knowledge; key concepts for studying groups; overviews of the literatures on empire and colonialism and the entanglements of social science with settler colonialism; the emergence and co-constitution of modernity, empire, settler colonialism, states and indigeneity; property, dispossession and capitalism; biopolitics, reproduction, sexuality, gender; the US as a settler colonial formation; political contestation over settler colonialism and indigenous rights; native sovereignty, representation, decolonization and Indigenous justice.",

Most importantly, we will ask what poetry, memoirs, and novels have to offer as a way of understanding Latinx experiences.

This course will be given in coordination between Northwestern University and Princeton University, where another group of students is taking a similar course. To foster interaction and collaboration between students from both institutions, we will host two of the novel authors (one in person, one over zoom), organize workshops, and write assignments together. We all will examine why to write novels, what is micro-violence, and how the intimate experience of reading and the shared experience of discussing a novel can help us grasp the quotidian violence we and others experience, stimulate empathy, and promote solidarity.",

Together, we will explore several interrelated questions: (1) How have \"Spain\" and \"Europe\" variously been defined as modern, white, Christian, or secular by figuring Jews and Muslims as others? (2) How have these terms and the forms of life and history that they purport to represent changed over time? (3) What are the similarities and differences between the \"Jewish Question\" and the \"Muslim Problem\"? (4) How do Jews and Muslims understand themselves in relation to Spain, Europe, and to each other? At a time when racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and right-wing populist movements are ascendant in Spain and across Europe, we will work collaboratively to not only answer these questions, but to formulate new ones. To do so, we will consult scholarship in anthropology, history, cultural theory, and philosophy as well as on fiction, film, and journalism as resources. Throughout the term, we will be especially attuned to the forms of inclusion and exclusion that have affected Jews and Muslims in Spain, always with an eye toward how such abstractions come to matter in everyday life.",

The course builds on material learned in the first two quarters by introducing additional grammar and fundamental sentence structures, by presenting new vocabulary, and by providing students ample opportunities to practice and expand all skills. We will continue to use texts and audio centered around topics in Elementary Turkish I and II as well as work with additional printed audio and video material provided by the instructor. The course covers Unites 16-19 Elementary Turkish II.",

    "ClassOverview": "In this course, students will learn about Turkish history and culture through a study of the city of Istanbul. As one of the oldest cities in the world, straddling Asia and Europe, Istanbul presents a unique example of Turkish culture as a gateway between the East and the West. In this course, we will study the history and culture of Istanbul, its monuments and peoples, and aspects of daily life in the city, through authentic texts, videos, literary sources and guest speakers. Moving away from a traditional textbook-based model, this course content-based presents new and interesting materials that allow students to explore and compare in Turkish broader cultural, social, and political issues. The authentic texts and literary sources are accompanied by creative language learning exercises designed to help students function across different registers and genres.",
